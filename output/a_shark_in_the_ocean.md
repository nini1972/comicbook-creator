### **Panel 1**

**Description:** Wide shot of a beautiful, bustling coral reef. In the foreground, FINNY swims alone, a sad, wistful expression on his face. In the background, a colorful school of smaller fish, including GILLS the clownfish, quickly swim away into a sea anemone, peering out at Finny with fear. A trail of uneaten seaweed floats gently from Finny's mouth. Mood: Lonely, isolating.

**Dialogue:** 
*   **FINNY (thought bubble):** *Sigh... another day, another empty patch of ocean.*
*   **GILLS (whispering):** Keep away from him! You know the stories... He’s just *pretending* to eat that seaweed!

### **Panel 2**

**Description:** Finny, looking dejected, swims away from the main reef and discovers a hidden cove. Inside, a magnificent coral grove glows with a soft, ethereal light, but patches of it are dim and grey, the light flickering weakly. Finny’s eyes widen in awe and concern. Mood: Mysterious, wondrous, but tinged with sickness.

**Dialogue:** 
*   **CAPTION:** *The Whispering Grove... a place of ancient magic.*
*   **FINNY (to himself):** It’s... fading.

### **Panel 3**

**Description:** Close-up on the source of the problem. A large, rusty, metal barrel rests at the base of the coral. A thick, dark purple ooze seeps from a crack, swirling into the water and blanketing the nearby coral, draining its color and light. In the background, hiding behind a healthy piece of coral, SHELLY the turtle watches Finny with wide, worried eyes. Mood: Ominous, threatening.

**Dialogue:** 
*   **SHELLY (whispering):** The poison barrel... No one dares go near it. What's *he* doing here?

---

### **Panel 4**

**Description:** An explosive, dynamic action panel. Finny, with a look of intense determination, puts his entire body into shoving the barrel. His muscles are tense. The dark ooze swirls violently around him. Bubbles erupt from the effort. This is a clear display of the power everyone fears, but used for protection, not predation. Mood: Action-packed, heroic.

**Dialogue:** 
*   **SFX:** GRRRRUUUNNNCH!
*   **FINNY (grunting with effort):** NNGH! GOT... TO... MOVE IT!

---

### **Panel 5**

**Description:** Finny is floating, exhausted but triumphant, watching the barrel tumble into a dark, deep-sea trench in the distance. The Whispering Grove is already glowing brighter, the vibrant light pushing back the last of the murky water. Shelly and Gills have emerged from hiding, looking at Finny not with fear, but with shock and dawning admiration. Mood: Hopeful, triumphant.

**Dialogue:** 
*   **GILLS (stunned):** He... he saved it.
*   **SHELLY:** He saved *us*.

### **Panel 6**

**Description:** A heartwarming final panel. Finny is back at the main reef. He is now surrounded by the other fish, including Shelly and Gills, who are swimming alongside him. He is offering a piece of seaweed to a small, timid fish. For the first time, Finny has a wide, genuinely happy smile on his face. The whole scene is bright and full of life. Mood: Joyful, community, acceptance.

**Dialogue:** 
*   **FINNY:** Seaweed? It's my favorite.
*   **SHELLY (smiling at Finny):** You know, I’ve never tried it. Mind if I have a bite, friend?
