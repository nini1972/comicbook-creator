# Evaluator & Orchestrator System Proposal

## Problem Statement
Current comic generation suffers from:
- Visual Director fabricating non-existent image references
- No validation of generated content before assembly
- No retry mechanism for failed panel generation
- Quality control gaps leading to incomplete comics

## Proposed Solution: Two-Agent Quality Control System

### 1. EVALUATOR AGENT
**Role**: Quality Control Specialist
**Position**: Between Visual Director and Comic Layout Tool

#### Responsibilities:
- **Image Existence Validation**: Verify all referenced images exist in filesystem
- **Panel Completeness Check**: Ensure all required panels (1-6) are generated
- **Content Quality Assessment**: Basic checks for image relevance and quality
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generate comprehensive validation reports

#### Configuration:
```yaml
evaluator:
  role: >
    Comic Generation Quality Control Specialist
  goal: >
    Validate that all comic panels have been successfully generated with actual image files
    before allowing the comic to proceed to final assembly.
  backstory: >
    You are a meticulous quality control specialist who ensures that every comic panel
    exists as a real image file before the comic is assembled. You never accept fabricated
    filenames or incomplete work. Your validation prevents broken comics from being delivered.
```

#### Tools Required:
- **File Existence Checker**: Verify image files exist
- **Panel Validator**: Check panel numbering and completeness
- **Quality Reporter**: Generate detailed validation reports

### 2. ORCHESTRATOR AGENT
**Role**: Workflow Coordinator
**Position**: Above the entire generation pipeline

#### Responsibilities:
- **Retry Logic**: Re-run Visual Director for missing/failed panels
- **Error Recovery**: Handle different failure scenarios gracefully
- **Resource Management**: Prevent infinite loops, set retry limits
- **Final Quality Gate**: Ensure complete success before Comic Assembly

#### Configuration:
```yaml
orchestrator:
  role: >
    Comic Generation Workflow Coordinator
  goal: >
    Orchestrate the entire comic generation process, ensuring all panels are successfully
    generated through retries and error handling, delivering only complete comics.
  backstory: >
    You are a seasoned project coordinator who manages complex creative workflows.
    You ensure that no comic is considered complete until every panel exists and
    meets quality standards. You coordinate retries and handle failures gracefully.
```

#### Tools Required:
- **Workflow Controller**: Manage agent execution order
- **Retry Manager**: Handle selective panel regeneration
- **Status Tracker**: Monitor overall generation progress

## Enhanced Workflow

### Current Flow:
```
Story Writer → Visual Director → Comic Layout Tool
```

### Proposed Flow:
```
Story Writer → ORCHESTRATOR → Visual Director → EVALUATOR → Comic Layout Tool
                     ↑              ↓              ↓
                     └──── Retry Logic ←──── Validation Report
```

### Detailed Process:
1. **Story Writer** creates panel descriptions
2. **Orchestrator** initiates Visual Director with requirements
3. **Visual Director** attempts to generate all panels
4. **Evaluator** validates:
   - All image files exist
   - All panels (1-6) are present
   - Images match panel descriptions
5. **If validation fails**:
   - Evaluator reports missing/failed panels
   - Orchestrator triggers selective retry for failed panels only
   - Process repeats until success or max retries reached
6. **If validation succeeds**:
   - Comic proceeds to Layout Tool
   - Complete comic is assembled

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Evaluator Agent
1. Create evaluator agent configuration
2. Implement image existence validation tools
3. Create panel completeness checker
4. Add detailed reporting capabilities

### Phase 2: Orchestrator Agent
1. Create orchestrator agent configuration
2. Implement retry logic for failed panels
3. Add workflow coordination tools
4. Create resource management safeguards

### Phase 3: Integration
1. Update crew configuration to include new agents
2. Modify task flow to include validation steps
3. Update existing agents to work with new workflow
4. Add comprehensive error handling

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization
1. Test with known failure scenarios
2. Optimize retry strategies
3. Fine-tune quality control parameters
4. Performance testing with complex comics

## Benefits

### Immediate:
- ✅ Eliminate 404 errors from non-existent images
- ✅ Ensure all panels are actually generated
- ✅ Prevent incomplete comics from being delivered

### Long-term:
- ✅ Robust, self-healing comic generation pipeline
- ✅ Quality control for future enhancements
- ✅ Foundation for advanced validation (content, style, etc.)
- ✅ Reliable, production-ready system

## Risk Mitigation

### Infinite Retry Prevention:
- Maximum retry limit per panel
- Total generation timeout
- Progressive backoff strategy

### Performance Optimization:
- Selective panel regeneration (only failed ones)
- Parallel processing where possible
- Efficient file system checks

### Graceful Degradation:
- Partial success handling
- Clear error reporting
- Fallback strategies for critical failures
