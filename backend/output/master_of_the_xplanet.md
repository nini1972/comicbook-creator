Thought: The `Comic Layout Designer` tool has successfully generated the markdown for the comic strip. The output includes the descriptions and dialogue for all five panels, correctly formatted. Since the user context explicitly stated that image generation failed and no paths were available, this text-only layout is the correct and complete final product based on the available information. I will now add the Title and Logline from the original script to the final output for a complete presentation, as requested by the prompt ("Title and introduction," "Professional presentation").# The Littlest Subject

**Logline:** The bored and lonely ruler of a desolate planet finds an unexpected purpose when a tiny, lost creature crash-lands in his kingdom of dust.

---

## Panel 1
**Description:** A wide, establishing shot. We see MASTER KAELON slumped on a massive, brutalist-style throne carved from black rock. The throne room is a vast, empty cavern, open to the grey, dusty plains of the X-planet. Two dim suns hang in the purple sky. Kaelon rests his heavy chin on his fist, looking utterly bored. His four orange eyes are half-lidded. The scale is immense; he looks like a king with no kingdom.

**Dialogue:**
> **CAPTION:** X-PLANET. POPULATION: 1.
>
> **Kaelon (Internal):** Another glorious cycle as undisputed Master... of this rock. And that rock. And all the dust in between. The excitement is... palpable.

## Panel 2
**Description:** A streak of bright magenta light cuts across the sky outside the cavern opening, drawing Kaelon's attention. He lifts his head slightly, one eyebrow-ridge raised in mild curiosity. A thin trail of colorful smoke follows the streak. The sound effect should be small and almost comical.

**Dialogue:**
> **Kaelon:** Hmph. Debris. Finally, some new dust.
>
> **SFX:** *fweeeee-POOF!*

## Panel 3
**Description:** Close-up on the crash site, just outside the cavern. A tiny, smoking crater, no bigger than a dinner plate. In the center sits FUZZY, covered in soot, looking dazed and confused. Its large, shimmering eyes blink slowly as it looks around at the desolate landscape. It lets out a tiny, sad squeak.

**Dialogue:**
> **Fuzzy:** *Squeak?*

## Panel 4
**Description:** A low-angle shot from Fuzzy's perspective. The immense, intimidating shadow of Master Kaelon falls over it. We see Kaelon looming, his four glowing eyes looking down with an unreadable expression. One of his massive, rocky hands slowly reaches down towards the tiny creature. Fuzzy trembles, looking up in fear.

**Dialogue:**
> **Kaelon:** An intruder. In my domain. State your purpose, pest.
>
> **Fuzzy:** *Meeeeep!*

---

## Panel 5
**Description:** A complete shift in tone. A close-up shot focusing on Kaelon's hand and Fuzzy. Kaelon is not crushing the creature, but is instead gently using his massive index finger to nudge a small, glowing space-pebble towards Fuzzy. Fuzzy, no longer scared, nibbles cautiously on the glowing pebble. Kaelon watches with a newfound fascination, a tiny, almost imperceptible smile gracing his lips for the first time.

**Dialogue:**
> **Kaelon (Internal):** Hmmm. Perhaps the duties of a Master are more varied than I presumed.

> **CAPTION:** X-PLANET. POPULATION: ...2.
