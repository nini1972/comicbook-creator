## Panel 1
Description: Wide shot of Elena's cluttered, sunny bedroom. Elena is slumped dramatically over a small table by the window, her cheek resting on the wood. In front of her is a small terracotta pot containing a single, sad, wilting plant with drooping leaves. Sparky stands beside her, its head tilted, its screen displaying `?_?`.
Dialogue: **Elena (muffled):** "It's no use, Sparky. I think... I think Petey the Plant is a goner."
**Sparky:** "Query: 'Goner.' Probability of botanical life-function cessation is 87.4%."

## Panel 2
Description: A slightly chaotic, montage-style panel showing Sparky's attempts to "fix" the problem.
    *   **Mini-Scene A:** Sparky is using a giant funnel to pour an entire bag of "MEGA-GRO FERTILIZER" into the tiny pot, which is overflowing onto the floor.
    *   **Mini-Scene B:** Sparky aims a massive, industrial-looking heat lamp at Petey, who seems to wilt even more under the intense glare.
    *   **Mini-Scene C:** Sparky has placed large headphones on the pot, blasting classical music from a connected device. Music notes (`♪ ♫`) vibrate aggressively around the plant.
Dialogue: **SFX (from fertilizer):** *FOOMPH!*
**SFX (from lamp):** *VMMMMMM!*
**SFX (from music):** *BLARING BEETHOVEN*

## Panel 3
Description: Elena sits on the floor with her head in her hands, looking completely exasperated. The area around the plant is a mess of dirt, water puddles, and tangled wires. Petey looks worse than ever. Sparky stands in the middle of the mess, its screen displaying a buffering/loading symbol `[ . . . ]`. It holds a soil pH tester in one pincer.
Dialogue: **Elena:** "That's not helping, Sparky! You're just... solving the wrong problem!"
**Sparky:** "Data is insufficient. The problem is a lack of vitality. All logical solutions have been applied."

## Panel 4
Description: A quiet, gentle panel. The mess has been cleaned up. Elena is holding the pot in her hands, close to her face. Her expression is soft and caring. She is whispering to the plant. In the background, Sparky stands still, observing. The focus is on Elena's gentle actions. Its screen now shows an analyzing cursor `[ _ ]`.
Dialogue: **Elena (softly):** "It's okay, Petey. You just need a little encouragement. You can do it."
**Sparky (internal monologue):** "New variable detected: 'Encouragement.' Not quantifiable. Analyzing acoustic and proximity data..."

## Panel 5
Description: A tight close-up on the plant pot. A single, tiny, vibrant green sprout is pushing up from the soil. Sparky's metallic pincer-hand is extremely gently touching one of the older, drooping leaves, mimicking Elena's earlier touch. In the out-of-focus background, we can see Elena smiling, a genuine, warm smile. Sparky's screen, reflecting in a small puddle on the table, now displays a happy, content face: `^_^`.
Dialogue: **Sparky:** "Logical solution... updated."
