## Panel 1
Description: A wide, establishing shot. The tiny, metallic ‘Tikhon’ research pod floats precariously against the colossal, swirling canvas of Jupiter's Great Red Spot. Below, the storm is a maelstrom of color. Inside, seen through a large viewport, Dr. Aris Thorne is calmly sipping a nutrient paste from a pouch, his back to the window, focused on a data screen. The scene is quiet, almost serene. On the horizon of the storm, a darker, more violent vortex is visibly forming.
Dialogue: Mission Log: Sol 742. Atmospheric pressure remains stable, though a new cyclonic formation is gathering to the west. Nothing the Tikhon can't handle. Same old gas, different day.

## Panel 2
Description: A sudden, violent shift. The interior of the pod is a blur of motion. A jagged, purple bolt of lightning illuminates the scene from outside, casting harsh shadows. Aris is thrown from his chair, one hand braced against a console to stop himself from hitting the opposite wall. Red emergency lights are flashing, bathing the cockpit in a crimson glow. Alarms are blaring (visualized with jagged "KLAXON" sound effects).

Dialogue: WARNING! UNFORESEEN GRAVIMETRIC SHEAR. HULL INTEGRITY AT 80%.
ARIS: Nngh! Status report! What the hell was that?

## Panel 3
Description: A moment of eerie calm. The pod has been pulled deep inside the storm. Outside the main viewport, the chaos has subsided into a strange, tunnel-like structure of swirling gas—the eye of the storm. The clouds move in slow, deliberate, almost organic patterns, unlike any known weather formation. Aris has pulled himself back to the viewport, his hands pressed against the reinforced glass, his expression a mixture of fear and scientific curiosity.

Dialogue: Impossible... The models didn't show this. The patterns... they're not random.

## Panel 4
Description: A breathtaking and terrifying full-page splash. Outside the viewport, the swirling gases and lightning have coalesced. From the dense clouds, a colossal formation takes shape, unmistakably resembling a vast, multi-layered eye. It's not a perfect eye, but an elemental approximation made of gas, shadow, and crackling energy tendrils for an iris. It seems to stare directly into the pod—directly at Aris. His small, terrified face is reflected in the viewport glass, his own wide eye perfectly mirroring the cosmic one outside.

Dialogue: VMMMMMMMM...

## Panel 5
Description: The aftermath. The pod is now clear of the storm, which recedes into the distance. The interior is a mess—cables hang from the ceiling, a monitor is cracked. The red alert lights are off, replaced by the cool, normal blue operational lighting. Aris is slumped in his chair, not looking at his controls, but staring out the viewport at the retreating storm. His expression is no longer one of terror, but of profound, shell-shocked awe. He has a single tear tracing a path down his cheek.

Dialogue: Mission Log... Sol 742... Addendum. I... I was wrong. It's not just gas. There's something in here. And I think... I think it saw me.
