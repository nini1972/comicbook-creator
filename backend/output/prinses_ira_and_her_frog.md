## Panel 1
Description: A wide shot of the pristine, almost unnaturally perfect royal garden. Manicured hedges, geometrically arranged flowerbeds, a marble fountain in the center. Princess Ira is sitting slumped on a stone bench, chin in her hand, looking utterly bored. Ferdinand the frog is perched on the bench beside her, looking up at her with a concerned expression.

Dialogue: IRA (thought bubble): Another perfect day. Perfectly pruned. Perfectly pleasant. Perfectly... boring.
FERDINAND: Ribbit?

## Panel 2
Description: A close-up shot focusing on Ira and Ferdinand. A stunningly beautiful butterfly with shimmering, iridescent wings that glow with a soft, golden light flutters into the frame. It hovers right in front of Iraâ€™s face. Both Ira and Ferdinand stare at it, their eyes wide with surprise and wonder. The butterfly should be the most vibrant thing in the panel.

Dialogue: IRA (whispering): Woah... I've never seen a butterfly like you before.
SFX: shimmer

## Panel 3
Description: The butterfly darts away, leaving a faint trail of golden light. Ira jumps up from the bench, her posture now energetic and purposeful. She is looking in the direction the butterfly flew, a determined and excited look on her face. Ferdinand has leaped onto her shoulder, holding on tight.

Dialogue: IRA: Don't just fly away! Come on, Ferdinand, let's follow it!
FERDINAND: CROAK!

## Panel 4
Description: The scene is a forgotten, slightly overgrown corner of the garden. The magical butterfly is hovering next to a section of the high stone wall that is completely covered in thick, ancient ivy. Its glow illuminates a faint outline of a small, arched door hidden beneath the leaves. Ira is on her knees, carefully pushing aside the thick ivy with both hands, her face a mask of concentration and suspense. Ferdinand peers over her shoulder, his eyes wide.

Dialogue: IRA: A door... here? It must have been hidden for ages.
SFX: rustle, rustle

## Panel 5
Description: A large, impactful final panel. The perspective is from just behind Ira and Ferdinand as she pushes the small door open. The door opens into a breathtaking, magical landscape that contrasts sharply with the orderly garden. We see giant, glowing mushrooms, flowers in impossible colors, sparkling, floating motes of light, and the silhouette of a fantastical forest in the distance. The light from this new world pours out, bathing Ira and Ferdinand in a warm, magical glow. Their expressions are of pure, unadulterated awe.

Dialogue: IRA (breathless): Ferdinand... I don't think we're in the royal garden anymore.
