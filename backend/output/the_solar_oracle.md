Thought: The tool has successfully generated the markdown layout for the comic strip. Now I need to prepend the title and logline/intro and add placeholders for the images as requested in the instructions ("add a markdown image reference below each panel"). Then I will format it all for the final answer.# **The Sunstone's Price**

*A desperate man seeks a prophecy from a legendary Solar Oracle, only to discover that the light of knowledge casts the darkest shadows.*

***

## **Panel 1**
**Description:** A wide, establishing shot. We are high above a sea of clouds. The summit of a mountain pierces the sky, and on it sits a magnificent, open-air temple ruin. It's constructed from white marble and gold filigree. A massive, floating crystal, the Sunstone, hangs suspended in the center of the temple, pulsing with a gentle, golden light. A lone figure, KAEL, has just climbed the final steps, his back to the viewer, looking up at the awe-inspiring sight. The sun is brilliant and high in the sky.

**Dialogue:** Kael (Internal): "The stories were true... After all this climbing... the Sunstone Temple." (Sound Effect: FFFWSHHH)

## **Panel 2**
**Description:** Medium shot. Kael has entered the main chamber and is on one knee, head bowed before LYRA. Lyra stands before the pulsating Sunstone. Her blind, milky eyes are facing him, but she seems to see him perfectly. The light from the Sunstone casts long, dramatic shadows. Her expression is calm, neutral, almost sad.

**Dialogue:**
*   **Lyra:** "You have traveled far, son of the parched lands. Your feet carry the dust of a dying earth."
*   **Kael:** "Oracle! My villageâ€¦ the rains have vanished. The earth cracks. Please, show us the way."

## **Panel 3**
**Description:** A dramatic close-up on Lyra. She raises her hands towards the Sunstone. Blindingly bright tendrils of golden light leap from the crystal and coil around her arms, flowing into her. Her white hair begins to float around her as if underwater, and her blind eyes start to glow with intense, molten gold light. Her serene expression is now one of immense strain and concentration.

**Dialogue:** Lyra (Echoing): "The sun sees all. Its light... reveals. But every revelation... demands a price." (Sound Effect: VMMMMMMMM)

## **Panel 4**
**Description:** Splash panel showing the prophecy's vision, superimposed over Lyra. Lyra is in the foreground, face contorted in pain, golden energy streaming from her glowing eyes. The energy projects a hazy, ethereal image into the air before Kael (who is small in the corner, looking on in shock). The vision shows a single, luminous seed sprouting into a great tree, its roots drawing water from a hidden spring deep underground. But behind the tree looms the shadow of a mountain, a shadow that seems to be *consuming* the light.

**Dialogue:** Lyra (Prophetic): "**Beneath the weeping peak, the last seed sleeps. It will grant life, but its shadow will claim the mountain's heart.**"

## **Panel 5**
**Description:** A return to a quiet, wide shot, mirroring the first panel but from a different angle. Kael is walking away, down the steps, his back to us once more. His shoulders are slumped, no longer a hopeful supplicant but a man burdened with a terrible choice. In the temple, Lyra has collapsed to her knees, her hands on the stone floor. The light in her eyes has faded, as has the glow from the Sunstone. Faint, golden cracks, like cooling lava, are visible on her arms before they fade away. She looks utterly drained and ancient.

**Dialogue:** Kael (Internal): "The mountain's heart... That is our ancestral mine. The price of water... is our home." (Sound Effect: Silence)
