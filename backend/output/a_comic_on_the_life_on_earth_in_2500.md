Thought:I have successfully called the `Comic Layout Designer` tool with the extracted panel descriptions, dialogue, and image paths. The tool returned the complete comic layout in markdown format.

My final instruction is to return ONLY the tool's markdown output. I will now format the final answer to contain only the markdown.# Comic Strip Layout

## Panel 1
Description: WIDE SHOT. We are in a minimalist, high-tech room. The walls are seamless and white, with a large, panoramic window showing a futuristic cityscape of towering chrome spires and flying vehicles under a perpetually hazy, artificial sky. ELARA is in her advanced bio-chair on the left, looking out the window. KAELEN stands beside her, holding a transparent data-slate, his posture professional but slightly detached.

Dialogue: Elara: They say the sky used to be blue. Truly blue. Not this… engineered ceiling.
Kaelen (flatly): The atmospheric filters optimize for UV protection and light-cycle regulation, ma'am. It's for our health.

## Panel 2
Description: MEDIUM SHOT. A closer view of Elara as she turns her head to look at Kaelen. Her expression is wistful and pleading. A close-up on her wrinkled hand gesturing slightly.

Dialogue: Elara: I don't want to see it, son. I want to *smell* it. Before the weather was… tamed. I want to remember the smell of real rain on dry earth.
Kaelen (looking at his slate): Petrichor. A Tier-9 sensory memory. Extremely rare. Most data from the "Wet Era" is corrupted. It will be costly.

## Panel 3
Description: CLOSE UP on Kaelen’s face, bathed in the blue glow of a massive, holographic data-sphere in his archive lab. Lines of code and fragmented images swirl around him. His brow is furrowed in intense concentration, his fingers deftly manipulating the holographic interface, sifting through chaotic streams of data.

Dialogue: SFX: *click… whirr… search…*
Kaelen (Caption Box): Corrupted files. Synthetic reconstructions. Fakes. For days, I found nothing but digital ghosts. What did something so simple even *feel* like?

## Panel 4
Description: EXTREME CLOSE UP on Kaelen's eye. Reflected in his pupil is a tiny, newly-found, glowing data fragment—a vibrant green leaf with a single, perfect water droplet on it. His eye widens in surprise and discovery.

Dialogue: SFX: *Blink!*
Kaelen (Dialogue, whispered): There. A fragment. Uncorrupted. Locked in a botanical archive from 2088.

## Panel 5
Description: SPLASH PANEL. We are inside Elara's memory. The panel is borderless and bleeds to the edges of the page. The perspective is from Elara's POV, looking down at her own younger, bare feet on dark, rich soil. Fat raindrops are splashing onto the ground and her feet, kicking up tiny puffs of dust. The world is lush, green, and alive. In the real world, a single tear rolls down the cheek of the elderly Elara in her chair, a serene smile on her face. Kaelen watches her, his detached expression finally broken by one of awe.

Dialogue: Elara (Dialogue, faint and ethereal): Oh… yes. That’s it. That’s… life.

## Panel 6
Description: Same as Panel 1, but now Kaelen is standing alone, looking out the panoramic window at the sterile city. His posture is different—less rigid, more thoughtful. He holds his hand up to the window, palm flat against the glass, as if he could feel something on the other side.

Dialogue: Elara (Off-panel dialogue, a soft echo): …life.
Kaelen (Caption Box): She paid me for a memory. But for the first time, I felt like I was the one who had been given something real.
