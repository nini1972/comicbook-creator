Thought
The user wants me to assemble the final comic strip.
I have been provided with the full comic script, which includes panel descriptions and dialogue, and a list of generated image paths for each panel.
My task is to use the `Comic Layout Designer` tool to create the final comic layout.
I will extract the panel descriptions, dialogue, and image paths from the provided context and pass them to the tool as lists.

1.  **Panel Descriptions**: I will take the 'Visual Description' for each of the 6 panels.
2.  **Dialogue**: I will take the dialogue and sound effects for each of the 6 panels and format them into a single string per panel.
3.  **Image Paths**: I will use the provided list of 6 image paths.

I will then call the `Comic Layout Designer` tool with these three lists. The tool's direct output will be my final answer, as per the instructions.Action

"panels": [
"A wide shot of the \"Stardust Cruiser's\" cockpit. Lyra is slumped in her pilot's chair, chin resting in her palm, looking utterly bored. The vastness of space is visible through the panoramic viewport, with the Andromeda galaxy being a beautiful but distant, indistinct swirl of light far away. Various holographic displays float around her, showing stable, green-lit system diagnostics. Nimbus hovers silently next to a console.",
"A medium close-up on Lyra. Her eyes drift from the main viewport to a smaller holographic star chart floating to her left. A mischievous, determined spark ignites in her eyes. Her bored expression is replaced by a sly grin. She raises a single finger, pointing towards a spot on the chart much closer to the galaxy.",
"Tight shot on Lyra's hand as she confidently swipes across a holographic control panel. The green \"AUTO\" light switches to a flashing red \"MANUAL.\" Her knuckles are white as she grips the flight stick.",
"An external shot of the \"Stardust Cruiser.\" The small, sleek ship suddenly lurches, its engines flaring with intense blue energy as it breaks from its gentle trajectory. It leaves a sharp, bright trail of light against the blackness of space, rocketing directly towards the now-growing Andromeda galaxy.",
"A large, breathtaking double-page spread, or a full-bleed single panel. The \"Stardust Cruiser\" is a tiny silhouette, completely dwarfed by the majestic, overwhelming view of the Andromeda galaxy. We are right at the edge. Swirling nebulae of incandescent pink and deep violet gas clouds twist around colossal star clusters that glitter like diamond dust. The sheer scale is immense and awe-inspiring. Inside the cockpit, Lyra is pressed back against her seat, her face bathed in the galaxy's ethereal light. Her eyes are wide, her mouth slightly agape in pure, unadulterated awe.",
"Back to the calm interior of the cockpit. The ship is cruising smoothly again, back on its original course. The Andromeda galaxy is once again receding in the viewport, but it looks closer and more brilliant than before. Lyra is leaning back in her chair, a wide, peaceful smile on her face. She gently pats the console. Nimbus hovers beside her, projecting a soft, glowing, happy smiley face. The red \"MANUAL\" light is now off."

"dialogue": [
"Lyra (Internal Monologue): Log Day 247. Nothing but dust and echoes. They call this \"scouting.\" I call it the long, slow nap.\nNimbus (Sound FX): Bleep. Bloop.",
"Lyra: So... what's the recommended safe viewing distance for a galactic marvel, Nimbus?\nNimbus: The recommended distance is our current distance, Lyra. Regulation 7.4 of the Explorer's Codex clearly statesâ€”",
"Lyra: Regulations are for people who don't have front-row seats.\nNimbus (Dialogue balloon with jagged edges): Detour initiated! That is a suboptimal decision! Engine stress levels rising!",
"SFX: VWOOOOSH!",
"Lyra (Whispering): Whoa...\nNimbus (Projecting a simple, holographic \"WOW\" emoticon): ...Data logs will not do this justice. Suboptimal... but magnificent.",
"Lyra: See? Sometimes you have to get a little lost... to remember what you're looking for.\nNimbus: Acknowledged. Updating my definition of \"scouting.\""
