Comic assembly process halted.

**VALIDATION STATUS: FAIL**

Cannot proceed with comic layout and assembly. The image generation task failed to produce any of the required 6 panel images. All panels are missing.

**Recommendation:**
Manual intervention is required. Escalate to the technical team to investigate the root cause of the image generation failures as detailed in the "Orchestration Report". Do not re-run the comic creation pipeline until the image generation service is confirmed to be operational and all 6 panel images can be successfully created.
