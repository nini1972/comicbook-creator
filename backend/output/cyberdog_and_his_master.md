## Panel 1
Description: A wide shot of a messy, sun-drenched workshop/kitchen area. Alex is on his knees, head and shoulders stuck inside the base of a futuristic-looking but clearly broken coffee machine. Tools are scattered around him on the floor. Sparks fly from the machine's innards. Bolt sits patiently nearby, his head cocked to the side, his blue optic sensors focused intently on Alex. The emoji on his collar is a a pensive, thinking-face (ü§î).
Dialogue: SFX: *SPUTTER! FZZT!*
**Alex (Muffled):** 'Come on, you bucket of bolts... just give me one decent cup...'

## Panel 2
Description: A close-up on Alex as he pulls his head out of the machine, smudged with soot and looking utterly defeated. He slumps back against the counter and lets out a huge, exasperated sigh, running a hand through his already messy hair. In the foreground, we see Bolt's reaction. His optic sensors widen, and the emoji on his collar instantly changes to a 'distress' symbol (‚ùó). A small panel on his side whirs open slightly.
Dialogue: **Alex (Sighing):** 'Uuuuugh. It's hopeless. The primary flow regulator is completely shot.'
**Bolt:** *Whirr-Beep?*

## Panel 3
Description: Action panel. Bolt is a blur of motion. He has launched himself towards a small, circular pet door in the wall. The camera is low, emphasizing his speed. The emoji on his collar is now a determined, 'mission' face (üéØ). Outside the window, a small, sleek delivery drone from 'Cyber-Caffe' can be seen hovering in the distance.
Dialogue: **Alex (Off-panel):** 'Bolt? What's gotten into you?'
**SFX:** *WHOOSH!*

## Panel 4
Description: Alex is looking bewildered at the open pet door when Bolt zips back in. Bolt is now proudly carrying a brand-new, top-of-the-line espresso machine in a specialized gripping appendage that has extended from his back. The machine is still in its pristine packaging, bearing the 'Cyber-Caffe' logo. Alex‚Äôs jaw is on the floor, his glasses askew with shock. Bolt sets the machine down perfectly on the counter, wagging his metallic tail. The emoji on his collar is a happy, proud dog face (üê∂).
Dialogue: **Bolt:** *Beep-Boop! BARK!*
**Alex:** 'Bolt... where... where did you get that?'

## Panel 5
Description: Final panel. The new machine is humming contentedly, having just poured a perfect, steaming cup of coffee. Alex holds the mug in both hands, taking a blissful sip, his eyes closed. His expression is one of pure relief, though a small bead of sweat runs down his temple. Bolt sits at his feet, looking up at him with adoration. The emoji on his collar is a simple, happy heart (‚ù§Ô∏è).
Dialogue: **Alex (Thought Bubble):** 'Okay... I'll figure out how to return it.'
**Alex (Thought Bubble, smaller font):** '...Right after this coffee.'
**SFX:** *<Huuuuuummm>* (from the new machine)
