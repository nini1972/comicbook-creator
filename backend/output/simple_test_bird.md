# **Comic: "The Test"**

**Logline:** A small bird, living a monotonous life as a lab subject, is given an unexpected chance to escape and must choose between the safety of his cage and the terrifying allure of the outside world.

### **Panel 1**
*   **Description:** A tight, claustrophobic shot focusing on Pip inside his sterile, white metal cage. He is perched listlessly on a smooth metal bar. Wires are discreetly attached to the cage walls. Outside the bars, a scientist's blue-gloved hand is methodically turning a dial on a piece of complex-looking machinery. A simple digital monitor next to the dial displays a flat, green line. The background is a cold, out-of-focus blur of lab equipment.
*   **Dialogue:** SFX: *BEEEEEP…* (A monotonous, low-pitched electronic note from the machine).

### **Panel 2**
*   **Description:** A wider shot showing more of the lab. In the foreground, the legs of a clumsy lab assistant are tangled up, sending them crashing to the floor. A glass beaker filled with a vibrant, glowing green liquid is in mid-air, arcing directly towards Pip’s cage. Pip, now on his feet on the perch, has his wings half-raised in alarm, his eyes wide with shock.
*   **Dialogue:** SFX: *CRASH!*

<br>

### **Panel 3**
*   **Description:** A dramatic close-up on the simple metal lock of Pip’s cage door. The spilled green liquid is sizzling and corroding the metal, emitting small puffs of acrid smoke. The liquid has eaten through the latch mechanism. The small cage door has swung silently open, creating a dark, rectangular void leading out.
*   **Dialogue:** SFX: *FZZZZZZT!* followed by a soft *click*.

<br>

### **Panel 4**
*   **Description:** A pivotal shot from inside the cage, looking over Pip’s shoulder. He stands at the very edge of the open doorway, his tiny bird-claws gripping the precipice. His small shadow stretches out onto the lab floor before him. In the distance, framed perfectly, is a large, open window. Through it, a world of overwhelming color is visible: the deep green of a tree’s leaves and a sliver of impossibly blue sky. Pip is tensed, caught between the familiar grey of his cage and the vibrant unknown.
*   **Dialogue:** (Complete silence. No sound effects. The moment is held in suspense.)

<br>

### **Panel 5**
*   **Description:** A beautiful, wide, borderless panel. Pip is perched on a natural, textured tree branch just outside the window. The warm sunlight illuminates him, making his yellow feathers glow for the first time. A gentle breeze ruffles his plumage. He has his head tilted up towards the vast, endless blue sky, his beak slightly open. In the far background, the lab window is just a small, insignificant square.
*   **Dialogue:** SFX: *Chirp!* (This is not the electronic beep from before, but a single, pure, musical note. The first true note of his life.)
