# The Sound and the Fury

**Logline:** A grumpy shark's nap is disturbed by a singing whale, but their conflict is interrupted by a greater danger, forcing an unlikely alliance.

## Panel 1
**Description:** A wide, underwater shot establishing the scene. WALLY the whale is floating peacefully mid-water, eyes closed in blissful concentration. His mouth is wide open, and massive musical notes and soundwave ripples (drawn visually) are emanating from him, shaking the entire panel. In the foreground, nestled in a sandy patch near a coral reef, SHERMAN the shark is being violently jolted out of a nap. His eyes are wide with fury, and little puffs of sand are kicked up around him from the vibrations. Small fish are seen zipping away from the noise.

**Dialogue:** 
WALLY (sings): ♫ BAAAA-ROOOOOO-OOOOOM! ♫
SHERMAN (thought): GAH! Not again!

## Panel 2
**Description:** A dynamic, low-angle shot looking up at Wally. SHERMAN has zipped up to Wally's face and is nose-to-nose (or nose-to-chin, given the size difference) with the giant whale. Sherman’s fins are flared, his teeth are bared in a snarl, and his body language is pure rage. WALLY has stopped singing, his eyes now open and looking down at Sherman with a mix of surprise and confusion. A single, small musical note hangs in the water between them, looking lonely.

**Dialogue:** 
SHERMAN: HEY! MOBY THICK! Do you mind?! Some of us are trying to maintain a healthy sleep cycle!
WALLY: Oh! I'm so sorry, little fella. I was just practicing my kelp-soprano. Did you hear that high note?

## Panel 3
**Description:** The perspective shifts to a medium shot showing both characters. Suddenly, a massive, dark shadow falls over them from above. Thick, dark ropes of a fishing net are dropping rapidly into the water between them. The mood instantly changes to one of alarm. Both Wally and Sherman look up, their argument forgotten. Their eyes are wide with panic. The beautiful, sun-dappled water is now menacingly shadowed.

**Dialogue:** 
SHERMAN: What in the...
WALLY: Look out!

## Panel 4
**Description:** An action-packed panel. The net has partially ensnared WALLY's massive tail fluke. He is thrashing, causing huge water currents. SHERMAN, with a look of fierce determination, has sprung into action. He is biting and tearing at a thick junction of the net's ropes near Wally's tail. We see strands of the rope snapping in his jaws. Wally, seeing Sherman's effort, uses the free part of his fluke to slam the water, creating a powerful push that keeps the net from tightening further, giving Sherman the slack he needs.

**Dialogue:** 
SFX: SHRED! RRIP!
WALLY: Almost there! A little more!
SHERMAN (muffled): I'M... WORKIN' ON IT!

---

## Panel 5
**Description:** A quiet, peaceful panel. The torn, useless net is drifting away into the background. WALLY and SHERMAN are floating side-by-side, both breathing heavily (as much as fish and mammals can). They are looking at each other, not with anger or fear, but with a newfound respect. Sherman's scowl has softened into a neutral, almost thoughtful expression. Wally gives him a small, grateful smile. A single ray of sunlight breaks through the water, illuminating them both.

**Dialogue:** 
WALLY: You... you saved me. Thank you.
SHERMAN: Yeah, well... Can't have you waking me up if you're stuck in a net, can I?

## Panel 6
**Description:** A final, wide shot. Wally and Sherman are swimming away together, side-by-side, into the bright blue yonder. They are no longer confrontational but appear to be companions. The ocean around them looks vast and full of possibility.

**Dialogue:** 
WALLY: You know, for a scary shark, you're not so bad.
SHERMAN: Just... try and practice your singing a little further away next time. Maybe over by the continental shelf.
WALLY: Deal! ♫ ba-rooo...? ♫
