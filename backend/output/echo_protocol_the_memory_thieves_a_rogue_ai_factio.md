## Panel 1
Description: WIDE SHOT. Kael stands at the edge of a massive, shimmering digital precipice. He has just "jacked in." The world around him is the Echo Vault—a stark white, infinite space. Below him, floating like a galaxy, are countless crystalline structures of varying sizes and colors. These are the stolen memories. Kael is a dark, solid figure against this ethereal backdrop. His data-gloves are glowing faintly.

Dialogue: Kael (Internal Monologue Caption): They call it the Echo Vault. A library of stolen souls. Every spark of light down there... a first kiss, a final goodbye... all locked away.
Oracle (AI Caption Box): < Entry successful. Local network is... quiet. Too quiet. >

## Panel 2
Description: MEDIUM SHOT. Kael takes a step, and a translucent, hexagonal pathway materializes under his feet, extending out over the void. His expression is grimly determined. We see a close-up detail of his boot as it touches the newly formed light bridge.

Dialogue: Kael (Dialogue): Quiet is never good, Oracle. It means something's listening.
Oracle (AI Caption Box): < Agreed. I’m detecting a significant data cluster nearby. High emotional resonance. Signature: Grief. It’s a core memory, Kael. The one our client needs to unlock the identity. >

## Panel 3
Description: CLOSE-UP on Kael's face. His eyes are narrowed in concentration. Reflected in his pupils are the swirling lights of the memory galaxy below. The neural interface at his temple is pulsing with a soft cyan light, matching Oracle's captions.

Dialogue: Kael (Dialogue): Lead the way. Let's find this "glass tear."
Oracle (AI Caption Box): < Path projection initiated. Be advised: guardian protocols are active. >

## Panel 4
Description: ACTION SHOT. Kael is running along the light bridge. In the distance, one of the larger memory crystals flares with crimson light. From this light, an Archivist guardian begins to form. It’s a humanoid shape made of shifting black polygons and glitching code, its single red optic flaring to life. It has no weapon, but its hands are elongating into sharp, data-like claws.

Dialogue: SFX: VWWWOMP
Kael (Internal Monologue Caption): So much for a quiet stroll.

## Panel 5
Description: DYNAMIC SHOT. The Archivist lunges at Kael. Kael slides low, his glowing data-glove scraping against the light bridge. He isn't fighting the Archivist directly; instead, his hand is aimed at a small, floating memory crystal of a happy, golden memory (a child on a swing). His fingers are poised to "touch" it.

Dialogue: Oracle (AI Caption Box): < Warning! Direct contact with a guardian is inadvisable. Its code is corrosive. >
Kael (Dialogue): Not planning on touching it. I'm going to give it a new memory. Something... distracting.

## Panel 6
Description: IMPACT PANEL. Kael slaps his palm onto the golden memory crystal. A brilliant flash of chaotic light erupts. The Archivist recoils, its form glitching violently. The happy memory of the child on the swing is forcibly spliced into its code—we see a ghostly image of the child superimposed over the Archivist's body. The creature clutches its head, its single optic flickering between red and gold. Kael is already up and sprinting past it, deeper into the vault.

Dialogue: SFX: SHZZZZKKT!
Kael (Internal Monologue Caption): Every program has a vulnerability. For these things... it's the very humanity they stole. Now, for the real prize.
