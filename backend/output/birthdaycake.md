Action Input: {"panels": ["A close-up shot of Caky sitting majestically on a glass cake platter on a granite kitchen counter. The background is slightly blurred, showing glimpses of party balloons. Suddenly, two chocolate drops on his face pop open, revealing wide, curious eyes. A small 'pop!' sound effect is near his head. He has a look of pure astonishment.", "A wider shot. Caky is now at the edge of the counter, peering down. The drop to the tiled floor looks immense and intimidating from his perspective (a low-angle shot looking up at Caky would emphasize this). His frosting face is a mask of determination mixed with fear. He’s inching himself forward, leaving a faint smear of frosting behind.", "Action shot! Caky is on the kitchen floor, rolling on his side like a wheel. He's zipping past a giant (from his POV) red toy race car and a stray building block. Motion lines trail behind him to show speed and excitement. His expression is one of pure exhilaration and freedom.", "Caky has stopped rolling and is propped against a shiny, stainless-steel pot lid on the floor. He sees his reflection—a smudged, slightly disheveled cake. His expression turns from joy to melancholy. In the background, out of focus, we see Leo's sneakers as he speaks to his mom. A speech bubble originates from off-panel.", "The final, heartwarming panel. A tight shot focusing on Leo's face, which is glowing with pure, unadulterated joy. His eyes are wide and sparkling as he looks down at Caky. We see Caky back on his platter, perfectly centered on the table. His single candle is now lit, its flame casting a warm glow on Leo's face. Caky's frosting face is beaming with a new, profound happiness. He understands his purpose."], "dialogue": ["Caky (Thought Bubble): Whoa... Where am I? What am I?", "Caky (Thought Bubble): They called me... a 'cake.' And they're going to EAT me! Not before I see the world!", "Caky (Sound Effect): *Wheeeee!* \nCaky (Thought Bubble): This is amazing! I'm an adventurer!", "Leo (off-panel): Mom, is it time for my cake yet? I can't wait! It's going to be the best part of my whole birthday! \nCaky (Thought Bubble): The best part...? For... him?", "Leo: Wow... \nCaky (Thought Bubble): Okay... I'm ready."]}
