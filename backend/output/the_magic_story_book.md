# Comic Strip Layout

## Panel 1
Description: Wide shot. We are in a forgotten, dusty corner of a grand, old library. Sunlight streams in from a high, arched window, illuminating floating dust motes. Towering shelves filled with old tomes surround the space. ELARA is on her knees, having pulled out a heavy, leather-bound book from the bottom shelf. The book has no title, only an intricate, embossed symbol of a spiraling tree on its cover. She is blowing a layer of dust off it, her expression one of intrigued discovery.

Dialogue: Elara (thought bubble): Hmm, I've never seen this one before. No title... no call number... SFX: Poooof

## Panel 2
Description: A closer shot on Elara, who is now sitting on the floor, cross-legged, with the book open in her lap. A brilliant, golden light erupts from the center of the book. Elara leans back sharply, her eyes wide with shock and her glasses knocked askew. Her hands are still on the book, but she’s recoiling from the light. The light is coalescing into the small, bright form of PIP, the sprite, who is stretching as if waking up.

Dialogue: Elara: Whoa! SFX: FWOOSH!

## Panel 3
Description: Action shot. The panel is split diagonally to convey energy. On one side, PIP is a zippy golden blur, darting through the air and leaving a sparkling trail. He has just playfully nudged a stack of books, which are now tumbling off a nearby shelf. On the other side, a panicked ELARA is scrambling to her feet, one hand reaching out futilely towards the sprite.

Dialogue: Elara: Hey! Wait! Come back here! SFX: Zip! Zip! Thump! Thump! Thud!

## Panel 4
Description: Close-up on Elara's face, but we can see the open book in her hands in the foreground. A lightbulb icon appears faintly beside her head. Her expression has shifted from panic to determined focus. She has an idea. She quickly flips through the pages of the magic book. Her fingers stop on a beautifully illustrated double-page spread of a serene, moonlit forest filled with glowing flowers.

Dialogue: Elara (softly): Okay... okay... running and shouting won't work. What if... you just wanted a better story?

## Panel 5
Description: A peaceful, heartwarming shot. Elara is sitting calmly on the floor, holding the book open and presenting the forest illustration. PIP, the sprite, has stopped zipping around. He is hovering just above the page, his glow soft and curious. He seems mesmerized by the illustration of the glowing flowers. His sparkling trail shows he has flown directly from the messy shelves toward the book.

Dialogue: Pip: ♪ Elara (whispering): See? Isn't it pretty? A quiet place to rest...

## Panel 6
Description: Final shot. We are looking over Elara's shoulder at the book. PIP has settled into the illustration. He is now a part of the artwork, a single golden sprite sitting peacefully on one of the glowing flowers on the page. The light from him is soft, pulsing gently. Elara is smiling, a look of fond relief on her face. With one finger, she gently traces the cover of the book before closing it.

Dialogue: Elara (to herself): Right back where you belong. The keeper of the glimmering page. SFX: click
