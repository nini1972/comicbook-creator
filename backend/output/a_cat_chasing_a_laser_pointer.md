I will now provide the final answer, which is an error message due to validation failure.
The final answer should not include any agent thoughts or reasoning, just the error message itself.Error: Comic assembly halted. The panel validation process has FAILED.

Reason: Panel 2 image file (`output\comic_panels\consistent_panel_002_mittens_1758729792769.png`) is missing and could not be found.

Action Required: Manual intervention is necessary to generate the missing image for Panel 2. Please resolve the image generation issue and re-run the validation before attempting assembly again.
