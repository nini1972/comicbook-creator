## Panel 1
Description: A wide, establishing shot. Princess Aurelia is a tiny, vulnerable figure standing amidst towering, gnarled trees that look like skeletal hands reaching for the sky. Long, dark shadows stretch across the forest floor, and twisted vines hang from the branches. Her posture is hunched, and she's hugging herself for warmth and comfort. Her eyes are wide with fear, scanning the ominous woods around her.

Dialogue: The Royal Woods were not as friendly once the sun had set... and Princess Aurelia was very, very lost.

## Panel 2
Description: A more focused shot. From the deep shadows between two thick tree trunks, a pair of intense, pale yellow eyes glow menacingly. We only see the silhouette of a large wolf (Fenrir), his head low and his ears perked. In the foreground, out of focus, we see the back of Aurelia's head. She has just turned, her body language frozen in terror as she spots the glowing eyes. A single tear rolls down her cheek.

Dialogue: **Aurelia (small, shaky whisper):** H-hello?

## Panel 3
Description: Split panel.

**Top Half:** Fenrir steps out of the shadows, revealing his full, imposing size. A low growl rumbles in his chest. His scarred muzzle and powerful build make him look dangerous.

**Bottom Half:** A close-up on Aurelia's feet. Startled by the growl, she stumbles backward over a tree root. As she falls, her only possession—a small, well-loved teddy bear with a button eye—slips from her grasp and lands with a soft *PLOP* in a muddy puddle.

Dialogue: **SFX:** GRRRRRRR...
**SFX:** PLOP!

## Panel 4
Description: A moment of high tension. Aurelia is on the ground, propped up on her elbows, looking at her sunken teddy bear with a look of utter despair. The wolf, Fenrir, stands over her. Instead of pouncing, he slowly lowers his massive head. He gently, almost delicately, nudges the muddy bear with the tip of his snout, pushing it out of the puddle and onto a patch of clean moss near Aurelia's hand. His expression is not aggressive; it's focused and calm.

Dialogue: **Aurelia (soft gasp):** ...!

## Panel 5
Description: A heartwarming close-up. Aurelia ignores the bear for a moment and looks up at Fenrir, her fear replaced by wide-eyed wonder and gratitude. A warm, golden light begins to filter through the canopy above them, illuminating the scene. She slowly reaches out a small, trembling hand. Fenrir leans forward, closing his eyes and gently resting his scarred muzzle against her palm. It's a moment of pure, silent understanding.

Dialogue: **Aurelia (a soft, wondering whisper):** You're... nice.

## Panel 6
Description: A hopeful final panel. Fenrir is now walking calmly beside Princess Aurelia, leading her down a path. She has one hand clutching her now-muddy teddy bear and the other gently resting on the fur of his back. The path ahead is bathed in the warm, golden light, suggesting the way out of the forest is near. Both characters look peaceful and content, an unlikely pair against the fading darkness of the woods.

Dialogue: In the darkest woods, she didn't find a monster. She found a guardian.
