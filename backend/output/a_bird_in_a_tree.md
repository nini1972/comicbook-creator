# The Treetop Trade

**A story of cooperation and clever bartering.** A young, ambitious bird named Pip is building his first nest and spots the perfect finishing touch: a shiny bottle cap. Unfortunately, a grumpy, territorial squirrel named Squeaky has already claimed it. Through a clever bit of bartering, Pip learns that cooperation can be more fruitful than conflict.

| **Description:** A wide shot showing a sturdy oak tree branch. In the foreground, Pip the bluebird is frantically weaving twigs into a messy, half-finished nest. He looks determined but slightly overwhelmed. His beak is full of grass. In the background, higher up on another branch, something glints brightly in the sunlight. |
| **Pip (thinking):** *Almost... there! Just needs... something special. Something with a little... sparkle!* <br> **SFX:** *Weave, poke, tuck* |

| **Description:** A close-up on Pip's face. His eyes are wide with wonder and excitement as he spots the source of the glint. A thought bubble appears above his head, showing the shiny object—a silver bottle cap—sitting perfectly in the center of his completed nest. |
| **Pip (whispering):** *Perfect!* |

| **Description:** Pip has flown up to the higher branch and is cautiously hopping towards the bottle cap. Suddenly, Squeaky the squirrel pops his head out from a knothole right next to the cap, startling Pip. Squeaky is holding the bottle cap protectively with one paw and has a very grumpy, 'get off my lawn' expression. Pip flutters back in surprise. |
| **Squeaky:** "Ahem! Finders keepers, feather-duster!" <br> **Pip:** "Oh! I-I'm sorry, sir. I just thought it would look so nice in my..." |

| **Description:** The panel is split. On the left, Squeaky is stubbornly hugging his bottle cap, turning his nose up. On the right, Pip looks dejected for a moment, but then his eyes light up. He has spotted something just above Squeaky's head—a large, perfect acorn hanging precariously from a thin twig, just out of the squirrel's reach. A lightbulb icon appears over Pip's head. |
| **Squeaky:** "My treasure! Not for some... *bird-house*." <br> **Pip:** "...But look! Up there! Isn't that an even *better* treasure for a distinguished collector like yourself?" |

| **Description:** A dynamic and happy scene. Pip is in mid-air, having just snipped the acorn's twig with his beak. The acorn is falling perfectly towards Squeaky's outstretched paws. Squeaky, for the first time, has a huge, greedy smile on his face. The shiny bottle cap rests on the branch beside him, forgotten. |
| **Squeaky:** "Whoa! The Motherlode!" <br> **SFX:** *SNIP!* |

| **Description:** A final, peaceful wide shot. On the left branch, Squeaky is happily munching on his giant acorn. On the right, lower branch, Pip is proudly placing the shiny bottle cap into the center of his now-completed nest. The bottle cap gleams, the perfect centerpiece. The two characters exchange a small, knowing glance of mutual satisfaction. |
| **Pip (thinking):** *Now that's special.* <br> **SFX:** *C R U N C H* |
