## Panel 1
Description: A wide shot establishing the scene. We are in a bleak, rocky wasteland under a perpetually twilight sky. The ground is cracked and barren. In the center of this desolation, the large, horned figure of KAEL is crouched low to the ground. His massive form is curled protectively around a single, tiny, wilting blue flower growing from a crack in the rock. He is using one of his fearsome claws with surgical precision to clear away a small, sharp stone from near its delicate stem. His expression is one of deep concentration and concern.

Dialogue: Kael (internal): ...Just a little more... You can make it...

## Panel 2
Description: A close-up on Kael's hands. One hand, large and monstrous, cups a few drops of water, which he is letting drip slowly and carefully onto the soil at the base of the flower. The contrast between the intimidating, clawed hand and the gentle act is the focus. The flower seems to have perked up ever so slightly.

## Panel 3
Description: A new figure enters the scene. SERAPHINA descends from the sky, a beam of golden light heralding her arrival. She lands silently a few feet behind Kael, her feet not even disturbing the dust. Her arms are crossed, and she looks down at Kael and his flower with a look of mingled pity and disgust. Kael flinches slightly, startled by the sudden bright light, and turns his head to look up at her.

Dialogue: Seraphina: "Filth and shadow, playing at life. How quaint."

## Panel 4
Description: A medium shot focusing on the two characters. Kael remains crouched, defensively shielding the flower with his body. He looks up at Seraphina, his expression not of anger, but of simple earnestness. Seraphina stands tall, her halo glowing brightly, casting a harsh light down on him. Her expression is a condescending, placid smile.

Dialogue: Kael: "It's... beautiful. It deserves a chance to grow."
Seraphina: "Beauty cannot blossom from corruption. Such things are not for your kind to tend."

## Panel 5
Description: The "action" panel. Seraphina takes a single step forward. She raises her foot, which glows with a soft golden light, and deliberately stomps down on the small flower. We don't see the impact itself, but we see the result: the petals are crushed and the stem is broken. Kael's eyes are wide with shock and horror, his hands reaching out too late. The light from Seraphina's foot is bright and "pure," making the act of destruction seem almost holy.

Dialogue: SFX: CRUNCH
Seraphina: "I am merely cleansing this land of imperfection. A mercy."

## Panel 6
Description: A final, quiet, and devastating shot. Seraphina is walking away, her back to the viewer, her form immaculate and bathed in her own golden light, disappearing into the gloomy sky. In the foreground, Kael is on his knees. He is gently cradling the crushed remains of the blue flower in his massive palms. A single, dark tear traces a path down his cheek. The vibrant blue of the flower is now dull and lifeless. The scene is silent and tragic.
