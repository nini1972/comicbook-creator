## Panel 1
Description: EXTREME WIDE SHOT. The small, rugged exploration vessel, the 'Icarus,' is a tiny speck being battered by colossal, swirling storms. We see it from the outside, descending through a violent canyon of orange and purple clouds. Lightning, the size of countries, flashes in the distance, illuminating the immense scale of Jupiter's upper atmosphere. The ship glows with the heat of atmospheric entry.

Dialogue: CAPTION: Jupiter. For a century, we dreamed of piercing its veil. We never dreamed of what lay beneath.
SFX: VVVVRRRRRRMMMMMM

## Panel 2
Description: INTERIOR COCKPIT SHOT. A close-up on DR. ARIS THORNE's face, reflected in his helmet visor. His eyes are wide with a mixture of fear and exhilaration. Outside the reinforced viewport, the chaotic storm clouds finally part, revealing a calm, luminous golden sea stretching to the horizon. It’s not gas; it’s a surface.

Dialogue: ARIS (DIALOGUE): Eva... look. The models were wrong. All of them. It's... a surface.
EVA (DIALOGUE, OFF-PANEL): Pressure stabilizing. Life support... nominal. Aris, what are we looking at?

## Panel 3
Description: LOW ANGLE SHOT. A heavy, armored boot makes an impression on the glowing, gelatinous ground. The surface quivers like firm jelly, and golden light ripples outwards from the footprint. We see the lower half of COMMANDER EVA ROSTOVA's spacesuit as she takes the first step off the ship's ramp. Aris is right behind her. The air is clear of storms, filled with a soft, ambient light from the ground itself.

Dialogue: EVA (DIALOGUE): Ground contact. Composition is... unknown. Organic polymers and... something else. It feels... resilient.
ARIS (DIALOGUE): It's beautiful. Like standing on a solidified star.

## Panel 4
Description: SPLASH PAGE / WIDE SHOT. Pull back to reveal the true scale. Eva and Aris are microscopic figures standing on what we now see is not a planet's surface. They are on a vast, undulating fin, miles long, covered in intricate, glowing patterns like the veins of a leaf. This fin rises from an even larger, shadowed shape below—a body that disappears into the golden mist. Other, similar fins can be seen in the far distance, lazily drifting. The 'Icarus' rests nearby, looking like a toy.

Dialogue: EVA (DIALOGUE): Aris... run a systemic scan. What *is* this place?
ARIS (DIALOGUE): ...Eva. We're not on a surface. We're *on* something.

## Panel 5
Description: EXTREME CLOSE-UP. A split panel showing both Eva's and Aris's faces inside their helmets. Eva's side: Her eyes are wide with dawning horror and disbelief. Her professional composure is completely gone, replaced by raw shock. Aris's side: A single tear escapes his eye, tracing a path on his cheek. His expression is one of pure, religious awe, as if he has just witnessed the face of God.

Dialogue: EVA (DIALOGUE): No... that's impossible. The scale...
ARIS (DIALOGUE): We thought Jupiter was a planet. It's an egg. And we're standing on the creature inside.

## Panel 6
Description: EXTREME WIDE SHOT. The same perspective as Panel 4, but the ground beneath the astronauts is now visibly *moving*. The entire continent-sized fin begins to slowly, majestically, *flex*. A deep, resonant vibration shakes the 'Icarus.' A low, planet-spanning sound begins, suggested by concentric circles emanating from the source of the movement. The golden light intensifies.

Dialogue: CAPTION: And it was beginning to wake up.
SFX: VVVVMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM...
