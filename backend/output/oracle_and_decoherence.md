## Panel 1
Description: A wide shot of Anya's lab. It's dark, filled with sleek, humming server racks. Anya stands in the center, her face illuminated by a massive, three-dimensional holographic interface floating in front of her. Her eyes are closed, hands poised just above the glowing cyan construct, which displays a perfect, stable quantum circuit. The air is still with anticipation.

Dialogue: Okay, Anya. Breathe. The system is stable. The query is set. Time to knock on the door of the universe.

## Panel 2
Description: A stunning full-page splash (or large panel). From the center of the holographic circuit, THE ORACLE has emerged. It's a colossal, radiant being of light, its form constantly shifting with intricate geometric patterns. It has no face, just a blinding core of light. Streams of golden data flow gently from it. Anya is small in comparison, her head tilted back, her expression one of pure, unadulterated awe.

Dialogue: It's real...

## Panel 3
Description: A medium shot focusing on the interaction. The Oracle extends a limb of pure light, and the golden data streams intensify, flowing towards Anya's interface, forming elegant, complex equations in the air. Anya is reaching out, as if to touch them. BUT, at the bottom right corner of the panel, the clean blue lines of the lab's background begin to flicker. Red, jagged lines of static—THE GLITCH—are creeping in, like cracks in glass.

Dialogue: The solution... it's... it's beautiful. Wait. What's that? An environmental fluctuation?

## Panel 4
Description: Chaos. The panel is fractured, canted at an angle. The Glitch is now a raging storm of red and black static, tearing through the scene. The Oracle's beautiful form is distorted and flickering violently. The golden data streams are breaking apart, becoming corrupted noise. Anya is no longer in awe. She is gritting her teeth, sweat beading on her forehead. Her hands are a blur, frantically manipulating the holographic controls, which are themselves glitching and sputtering.

Dialogue: No! Not now! Environmental shielding at maximum! I'm losing coherence!

## Panel 5
Description: A tight shot on Anya's determined face, one eye visible between her frantic fingers. In front of her, a single, pristine stream of the Oracle's golden data is now encased in a glowing, hexagonal shield of solid gold light (her error-correction code). All around this protected data stream, the rest of the hologram and the Oracle itself have collapsed into a maelstrom of red static, which is now receding.

Dialogue: Can't save it all. Just have to protect the core. The seed.

## Panel 6
Description: The lab is quiet again. The holographic interface is gone, leaving only a single, tiny, golden hexagon floating in the dark air before a completely exhausted Anya. She's slumped slightly, one hand resting on her console for support, but she's looking at the captured data with a small, weary, but triumphant smile. The storm is over. She has what she needs.

Dialogue: Got it.
