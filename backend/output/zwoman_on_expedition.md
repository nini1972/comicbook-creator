## Panel 1
Description: A wide, establishing shot. We are deep in a bioluminescent jungle on Planet X-42. Giant, twisted trees with glowing fungal patterns loom in the background. Strange, luminous flowers pepper the mossy ground. In the center of a small clearing, Z-WOMAN stands before an ancient, vine-choked stone pedestal. On top of it rests a crystalline artifact, pulsating with a soft, captivating blue light. Z-woman's posture is cautious but filled with awe. One hand hovers over a scanner on her wrist gauntlet.
Dialogue: Planet X-42. Log entry 734. The energy signatures were off the charts... but this... this is beyond anything the probes predicted.

## Panel 2
Description: A close-up shot focusing on Z-woman's gloved hand as it moves slowly towards the artifact. The crystal's light flares brightly as her fingers get within inches of it. Cracks of brilliant blue energy spiderweb across the surface of the stone pedestal. The air around it seems to vibrate, indicated by concentric rings of light.
Dialogue: VMMMMMMMMMM

## Panel 3
Description: A dynamic, slightly low-angle shot from behind Z-woman. A large, SPECTRAL GUARDIAN has materialized from the artifact's light. It's an ethereal panther-like creature made of shimmering teal energy and cosmic particles, with ancient, glowing runes etched onto its formless body. It lets out a silent, intimidating roar (mouth wide, energy flaring), its form crackling. Z-woman is jolted back, her body tensed in a defensive stance, eyes wide with surprise and alarm.
Dialogue: A single, complex runic symbol appears in a jagged, energy-filled speech bubble.

## Panel 4
Description: A tight close-up on Z-woman's face. Her initial shock has subsided, replaced by a look of intense concentration and dawning realization. Her eyes are narrowed slightly, not in aggression, but in thought. She is not reaching for a weapon. She's analyzing the situation.
Dialogue: You're not a monster... you're a sentinel.
(Internal Monologue): It's not a test of strength...

## Panel 5
Description: A medium shot showing both Z-woman and the Guardian. The tension has broken. Z-woman has lowered her hands and placed one open palm over her chest in a gesture of respect. The Spectral Guardian's aggressive posture has softened. It is now sitting regally, its form less crackly and more translucent, its head dipped in a sign of acceptance.
Dialogue: (Internal Monologue): ...it's a test of intent.

## Panel 6
Description: A final wide shot, mirroring the first panel but with a transformed atmosphere. The Guardian sits peacefully beside the pedestal. The artifact's glow is now a steady, gentle hum. Behind the pedestal, a section of the dense jungle wall has parted, the vines pulling back to reveal a hidden, illuminated path leading into a structure of beautiful, ancient ruins. Z-woman looks towards the new path, a small, determined smile on her face. The adventure has just begun.
Dialogue: Alright then. Let's see what you were protecting.
