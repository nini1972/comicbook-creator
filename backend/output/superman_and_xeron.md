Thought
I need to assemble the final comic layout using the provided script and generated images.

1.  **Panel Descriptions**: I will extract the visual descriptions for each of the 5 panels from the "Comic Script: Superman - Echoes of a Dead Star" section.
2.  **Dialogue**: I will extract the dialogue for each of the 5 panels.
3.  **Image Paths**: I will use the list of successfully generated image paths. I see paths for panels 1, 2, and 4. Panels 3 and 5 failed, so I will pass `null` or an empty string for those. I will also format the paths to match the required `/comic_panels/filename.png` structure.
    *   Panel 1: `/comic_panels/server_generated_gemini-image-tutorial_1758493110558.png`
    *   Panel 2: `/comic_panels/consistent_panel_002_xeron.png`
    *   Panel 3: `None`
    *   Panel 4: `/comic_panels/server_generated_gemini-image-tutorial_1758493166357.png`
    *   Panel 5: `None`
4.  **Tool Call**: I will call the `Comic Layout Designer` tool with these three lists as arguments.
5.  **Final Output**: I will return only the markdown output from the tool as the final answer.

Observation
# **Comic: Superman - Echoes of a Dead Star**
A powerful being named Xeron, the last survivor of a world destroyed by its sun, arrives on Earth. Believing that any being tied to a star's power, like Superman, is an inevitable catastrophe, he seeks to neutralize the Man of Steel. Their conflict becomes a battle not just of strength, but of ideology, trauma, and hope.

Thought
I have successfully called the `Comic Layout Designer` tool. The tool has generated a complete markdown layout of the comic strip, including the title, introduction, panel descriptions, available images, and dialogue. It also correctly notes where image generation failed. According to the instructions, my final answer must be ONLY the markdown output from the tool. Therefore, I will now provide that output as the final answer.
