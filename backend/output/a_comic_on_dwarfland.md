## Panel 1
Description: A wide shot of Borin's workshop. It's a cozy, well-lit cavern carved directly from the mountain rock. Tools hang neatly on the walls, and shelves are filled with uncut stones and geological charts. In the center, Borin is hunched over a heavy oak workbench, bathed in the warm, focused light of a multifaceted lantern. He holds up a large, fist-sized, uncut amethyst to the light, examining it with a jeweler's loupe pressed to one eye. His expression is one of deep, reverent concentration.

Dialogue: **Caption (Top Left):** Deep within the Grayfang Peaks, Master Jewelsmith Borin Stonehand pursued perfection.
**Borin (muttering to himself):** Almost... almost there. The luster... the clarity... magnificent.

## Panel 2
Description: An extreme close-up from Borin's point of view, looking through the jeweler's loupe. We see the deep purple, crystalline world inside the gem. The facets are sharp and perfect, but deep within the stone is a tiny, almost invisible hairline fracture. It's a jagged little line that ruins the internal symmetry. Borin's visible eye, just outside the loupe, is wide with disbelief and horror. A single bead of sweat rolls down his temple.

Dialogue: **Borin:** No... It can't be. A flaw!
**SFX:** *tink*

## Panel 3
Description: A shot from behind the workbench, looking up at Borin. He has thrown his head back and his hands are clenched into fists at his sides. His face is a mask of pure, unadulterated dwarven rage. His beard seems to bristle with indignation. The precious gem sits on a velvet cloth on the table, seemingly mocking him with its near-perfection. A few small tools (a file, a small pick) lie discarded next to it.

Dialogue: **Borin (in a large, explosive word balloon):** AFTER DECADES OF SEARCHING! CENTURIES OF STUDY! A FLAW?! CURSE THIS IMPERFECT ROCK!

## Panel 4
Description: A dynamic action panel. Borin, in a blur of motion, has snatched the amethyst from the table and is hurling it with all his might against the far stone wall of his workshop. His body is coiled with power, and his face is twisted in a furious snarl. The gem is a purple streak in the air, just about to make impact. Streaks of light emanate from the point of impending impact.

Dialogue: **SFX (Huge, dominating the panel):** **CRACK!**

## Panel 5
Description: A final, quiet panel. The amethyst lies on the floor in two perfectly symmetrical halves. Where it split, it has revealed a smaller, flawlessly cut, star-shaped crystal at its core that glows with a soft, internal white light, illuminating the cavern and casting a gentle glow on Borin's stunned face. Borin stands over it, his anger completely gone, replaced by an expression of pure awe. A slow, small smile just begins to form on his lips.

Dialogue: **Borin (in a small, hushed whisper):** Oh...
**Caption (Bottom Right):** For perfection was not in the stone he held... but what it held within.
