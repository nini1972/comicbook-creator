# **The Little Spinner**

**Logline:** A little boy, terrified of a spider in his room, is about to squash it when he discovers the tiny creature might not be the monster he imagined.

### **Panel 1**
**(Image placeholder: A wide shot of Leo's bedroom, dark and shadowy, with a single light on a small spider on the wall. Leo is in bed, looking terrified.)**

**Description:** A wide shot of Leo's bedroom. He is tucked into bed, covers pulled up to his nose, his eyes wide with terror. His bedside lamp casts a single, harsh spotlight on a small spider (Spinny) crawling up the wall opposite his bed. The rest of the room is draped in long, ominous shadows. Toys on the floor look like lurking monsters.
**Leo (Thought Bubble):** A monster! In my room!

### **Panel 2**
**(Image placeholder: Close-up on Leo's face, determined but scared, as he creeps forward with a large slipper.)**

**Description:** Close-up on Leo's determined but still frightened face. He has slipped out of bed and is now creeping across the floor. He is holding one of his dad's heavy slippers like a weapon, gripping it with both hands. His brow is furrowed in concentration. In the background, Spinny is frozen on the wall.
**Leo (Whispering):** Okay, Leo... you can do this. Be brave...

### **Panel 3**
**(Image placeholder: Over-the-shoulder shot of Leo, slipper raised, but he's frozen as the spider dangles from a shimmering thread of silk.)**

**Description:** An "over-the-shoulder" shot from behind Leo. He has the slipper raised high, ready to strike the wall. But he has stopped mid-swing. The spider, Spinny, has suddenly dropped from the wall on a single, shimmering strand of silk. It dangles in mid-air, spinning slowly, perfectly illuminated by the lamp light. It looks delicate, not threatening.
***SFX:*** *thwip!*

### **Panel 4**
**(Image placeholder: Tight close-up on Leo's face, his expression changed to wonder. The reflection of the spider is in his eyes.)**

**Description:** A tight close-up on Leo's face. His expression has completely changed. His fear is gone, replaced by wide-eyed wonder and curiosity. His mouth is slightly open in an "O" of amazement. We see the reflection of the gently spinning spider in his big blue eyes. The harsh shadows have softened. He is slowly lowering the slipper.
**Leo (Whispering):** ...Whoa. You're... a little acrobat.

### **Panel 5**
**(Image placeholder: Leo gently guiding the spider into a glass jar using a piece of paper. His face shows gentle concentration.)**

**Description:** A different angle. The slipper is now on the floor. Leo is holding an empty glass jar in one hand and a piece of paper in the other. He is incredibly gentle, carefully guiding the still-dangling Spinny into the jar with the paper. His movements are slow and deliberate. His face shows concentration and care.
**Leo (Softly):** Easy does it... Don't be scared.

### **Panel 6**
**(Image placeholder: Leo smiling peacefully by his open window at night, as the spider crawls from the jar onto a plant leaf.)**

**Description:** The final panel. Leo is kneeling by his open window. The jar is tipped over onto the leaves of a potted plant on the windowsill. Spinny is crawling out of the jar and onto a green leaf. The moon is visible in the night sky outside. Leo is smiling, a warm, genuine smile. The mood is peaceful and resolved.
**Leo (Happily):** There you go, little spinner. A much better home.
