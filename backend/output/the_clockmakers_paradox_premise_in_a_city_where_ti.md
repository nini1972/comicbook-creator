## Panel 1
Description: A wide, establishing shot. We are in Elian's workshop, a dusty, cluttered space tucked away in the underbelly of Chronos. Giant, slowly turning city-gears are visible through a grimy arched window. The shop is a chaotic sanctuary of half-finished clocks, scattered tools, and diagrams pinned to the walls. Elian is hunched over a workbench, his face illuminated by a single, flickering gas lamp. His expression is one of intense, weary concentration. In the foreground, a stray cat with a tiny brass gear for a collar sleeps on a pile of blueprints.

Dialogue: In Chronos, they trade lifetimes for moments of luxury. They spend their seconds, minutes, hours... never living them. They exiled me for heresy. For believing a clock's true purpose isn't to count what's lost.

## Panel 2
Description: A close-up on Elian’s hands. He’s gently prying open a small, tarnished wooden box he’s just found amidst a pile of scrap. Inside rests a strange timepiece. It's not a clock but a complex orb of interlocking brass rings, with a cracked crystal at its heart. The crystal emits a faint, pulsating, amethyst light that seems to subtly warp the air around it. The background is slightly out of focus, emphasizing the discovery.

Dialogue: What is this? The craftsmanship... it’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen. It doesn’t tick... it *breathes*.

## Panel 3
Description: A tight shot over Elian’s shoulder. He has the timepiece on his workbench, tools laid out neatly beside it. With a tiny screwdriver, he makes the first careful adjustment to one of the outer rings. As he does, the scene visible through the window outside changes. We see a glimpse of a brighter Chronos: the sky is a hopeful morning blue, and a smiling young couple is walking arm-in-arm on the street below, not glancing at the Time Banks. The light from the window is warm and optimistic.

Dialogue: Just a slight alignment... hmm. It feels... lighter. (SFX: KRRK)

## Panel 4
Description: Same angle as Panel 3, but the reality has shifted dramatically. Elian makes another adjustment. Now, the view through the window is a tragic one. Chronos is dark, under a torrential, oily rain. The street below is empty except for a lone, cloaked 'Time Collector' figure, their face hidden in shadow. The light from the window is cold and harsh. A 'visual glitch' effect starts at the edges of the panel, like a fractured piece of glass, showing a sliver of the 'hopeful' reality from Panel 3.

Dialogue: No... that can't be. I only moved it a fraction. (SFX: CRACK-KT)

## Panel 5
Description: A chaotic, surreal panel. Elian has pulled back from the workbench, his eyes wide with a mix of terror and awe. The timepiece is now glowing intensely on the table, the crack in its crystal spreading like lightning. The workshop is fracturing. Multiple realities are bleeding into one another. We see three overlapping versions of the cat: one sleeping, one a skeletal echo, one a being of pure light. The window shows the hopeful morning, the tragic rain, and a bizarre third reality of an alien, crystalline Chronos, all at once. The panel's borders themselves seem to be breaking apart.

Dialogue: It's not rewinding time... it's unwriting it! Every possibility, every future... all existing at once! (SFX: SHHHHRRRNNNNNN)

## Panel 6
Description: An extreme close-up on Elian’s face, split down the middle. One half shows him aged, weary, and horrified by the chaos he's unleashed. The other half shows a younger, hopeful Elian, seeing a chance to build a better world from the fragments. His hand is hovering over the broken timepiece, which is now a blinding nexus of temporal energy. His knuckles are white. The choice is clear in his eyes: will he try to force it shut and restore the sterile order he hated, or will he let reality shatter completely, hoping for something better to emerge from the paradox?

Dialogue: They wanted to control every second. But a second isn't a coin... it's a choice. And I must make mine.
