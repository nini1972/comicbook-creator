# The Princess in the Pages

A rugged adventurer, Kael, braves a dragon's lair to claim a legendary treasure, only to find that the "treasure" is a princess who is far from a damsel in distress and is simply trying to find a quiet place to read.

## Panel 1
**Description:** A wide shot establishing the scene. We are inside a vast, cavernous dragon's lair. Jagged stalactites hang from the ceiling, and glowing blue crystals embedded in the rock walls cast an ethereal light. In the center of the cavern, on a mound of tarnished coins and old bones, sits a massive, ornate treasure chest. In the deep background, the colossal, shadowy form of the sleeping dragon, IGNIS, is curled up. KAEL, our hero, stands before the chest, sword sheathed, chest puffed out in victory. He's dirty, his armor is scuffed, and he's breathing heavily, but a triumphant, greedy grin is plastered on his face.

**Dialogue (Kael's thought bubble):** After all these years... The Dragon's Hoard! I'm going to be legend!

## Panel 2
**Description:** A close-up shot focusing on Kael's hands and the chest. His hands are gripping the heavy lid of the chest. With a mighty heave, he lifts it. A brilliant, warm golden light pours out from the inside, illuminating his face with awe and expectation. The light is soft and inviting, not like the harsh glitter of gold.

***Sound Effect: KRAAANK!***

**Dialogue (Kael):** HERE IT IS!

## Panel 3
**Description:** The big reveal. A medium shot showing Kael frozen in place, his jaw hanging open in disbelief. The chest lid is fully open. Instead of gold, the chest is filled with stacks of old, beautiful books. Lounging comfortably atop the books, as if in a cozy armchair, is PRINCESS ELARA. She has one leg propped up, a book open in her lap, and she is looking up at Kael over the rim of her reading glasses with a distinctly annoyed expression. A magical floating orb provides her with reading light.

**Dialogue (Princess Elara):** (Sighs) Do you mind? You're letting a draft in.

## Panel 4
**Description:** A reaction shot, split into two smaller frames within the panel.
*   **Frame A (Left):** A tight close-up on Kael's face. His triumphant expression has completely vanished, replaced by one of pure, slack-jawed confusion. A single bead of sweat rolls down his temple. A small question mark appears beside his head.
*   **Frame B (Right):** A close-up on Princess Elara. She has bookmarked her page with a finger and is now giving Kael a deadpan stare. She taps her foot impatiently against a stack of books.

**Dialogue (Kael):** B-but... the treasure? The captive princess?

**Dialogue (Princess Elara):** The treasure *is* this first-edition collection of "Annals of the Sky-Sailors." And I'm not captive, I'm hiding from my etiquette tutor. Now, if you'll excuse me.

## Panel 5
**Description:** A wider shot, mirroring the composition of Panel 1. Kael is now backing away slowly from the chest, hands raised in a gesture of surrender and confusion. Elara has already gone back to her book, completely ignoring him. In the background, the dragon, Ignis, cracks open one lazy, reptilian eye, yawns a puff of smoke, and goes back to sleep. The adventurer looks small and defeated in the vast cave.

***Sound Effect: fwoosh...***

**Dialogue (Kael):** Right. Of course. Sorry to... uh... interrupt your reading. I'll just... show myself out.
