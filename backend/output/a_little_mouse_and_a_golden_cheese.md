## Panel 1
Description: A wide shot establishing the scene. We are in a rustic, old-fashioned pantry at night. Moonlight streams in from a high window. In the center of the room, on a tall, smooth wooden pedestal, sits the **Golden Cheese**. It's a perfect, enormous wheel of cheese that seems to glow from within. At the bottom left, tiny Pip stands on his hind legs, paws clasped together, looking up with an expression of pure awe and longing. His shadow stretches out long behind him.

Dialogue: The Golden Cheese... more beautiful than the legends say!

## Panel 2
Description: A sequence of three mini-panels or a single panel with action lines showing a montage of failed attempts.
    *   **Mini-panel A:** Pip tries to climb the smooth pedestal, his little claws making no purchase as he slides right back down with a *squeak*.
    *   **Mini-panel B:** Pip has built a wobbly tower of acorns and bottle caps, which is now collapsing spectacularly underneath him.
    *   **Mini-panel C:** Pip is trying to use a long piece of spaghetti as a pole vault, which just bends comically, plopping him back on the floor.

Dialogue: SFX: *SCRABBLE... SLIP!* SFX: *WOBBLE... CRASH!* SFX: *BOING!*

## Panel 3
Description: A low-angle shot. Pip is sitting slumped on the floor, his back against the pedestal, looking utterly defeated. His red scarf is slightly askew. His reflection is captured in a small, shimmering puddle on the stone floor. In the reflection, the Golden Cheese on its pedestal looms impossibly large and distant. A single tear rolls down his cheek.

Dialogue: It's no use... It's just too far away.

## Panel 4
Description: A sudden shift in perspective. A close-up on Pip's face. His head is still down, but his eyes have shot wide open. His gaze is directed towards the base of the pedestal, just past his reflection. He has spotted something he missed before: a tiny, almost invisible spiral staircase, no wider than a mouse's tail, carved delicately into the wood of the pedestal. It looks like a decorative pattern from a distance, but up close, it's a clear path. A small lightbulb icon could appear in his thought bubble.

Dialogue: Wait a minute...

## Panel 5
Description: A glorious, full-width panel. We are on top of the pedestal. Pip is standing right next to the massive, glowing Golden Cheese, which dwarfs him. He has taken a single, tiny bite (a small crescent is missing). His eyes are closed in pure, blissful ecstasy. His whiskers are twitching with delight, and a single crumb is perched on his nose. The warm glow from the cheese envelops him in a halo of golden light.

Dialogue: ...Worth it.
