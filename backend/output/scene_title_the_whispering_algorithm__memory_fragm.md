## Panel 1
Description: A wide, establishing shot. We are deep within the data temple. The scale is immense and awe-inspiring. Kaelen is a small figure in the foreground, his back mostly to the viewer. The beam from his headlamp cuts a path through the gloom, illuminating dust motes and the colossal, silent server racks that flank him like ancient statues. In the center of the cavern, further back, is the focal point: The Oracle, a kneeling figure of light, bowed before a single, starkly minimalist terminal that casts a powerful, pulsating cyan glow.

Dialogue: KAELEN (Internal Monologue): They called it the ‘Serversea Catacomb.’ Said the old world’s knowledge was buried here. Most thought it was a myth...

## Panel 2
Description: A medium shot moving closer to the scene. Kaelen stands just a few feet away from the Oracle and the terminal. He has deactivated his headlamp, his face now fully illuminated by the terminal's glow. His expression is one of pure, unadulterated curiosity and excitement, a scholar who has just found his holy grail. He holds a thin interface cable, its jack glinting in the light. The Oracle remains perfectly still, a shimmering, out-of-focus sentinel in the foreground.

Dialogue: KAELEN (Whispering): An active system... Pre-Collapse. The Oracle of Sub-Sector 9... It's real.

## Panel 3
Description: A dynamic, fractured panel.
*   **Main Image:** A tight close-up on Kaelen’s eyes. They are wide with concentration and wonder. Reflected in his pupils are cascading lines of archaic, alien-looking code from the terminal screen. A single bead of sweat traces a path down his temple, stopping just short of the neural interface port where he has just plugged in the cable.
*   **Inset Shard 1:** A jagged, flash-frame memory. A gleaming, impossibly tall chrome skyscraper against a brilliant blue sky.
*   **Inset Shard 2:** Another memory flash. The warm, smiling face of a woman, which dissolves into digital static at the edges.

Dialogue: SFX: *VMMMMNNNN...*

## Panel 4
Description: Kaelen is violently thrown back from the terminal, landing on one knee. He clutches his head, his face contorted in a mask of pain and utter confusion. His eyes are squeezed shut. The terminal screen is now filled with a single, complex, final string of code. Superimposed over the scene, like a ghostly double-exposure, is the memory he is receiving: A first-person view of a hand—*his hand*, with the same tattoo on the wrist—typing that exact final line of code onto an identical terminal. Through a window in the memory, a city is engulfed in digital fire and collapsing infrastructure.

Dialogue: THE SOURCE (Terminal): <sys.core> INITIATE ARCHIVAL PROTOCOL_7. IMPRINT: GUARDIAN. LOOP. >
KAELEN (Gasping): N-no... that's not a memory... that's... my hand...

## Panel 5
Description: A chilling final panel. The perspective is from behind the terminal, looking out. Kaelen is on the floor, staring in abject horror. The Oracle, the code-monk, has changed. It is no longer kneeling. It has risen slightly, its form less defined, more chaotic. Its "head" is now turned, a featureless face of shimmering code, looking directly at Kaelen. The singular cyan glow from the terminal now feels like a spotlight in a prison, trapping them both. The promise of knowledge has vanished, replaced by the terrifying certainty of a cage.

Dialogue: KAELEN (Whispering): It wasn't a legend... It was a warning.
