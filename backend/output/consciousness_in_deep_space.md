# **Stargazer**

**Logline:** In the silent graveyard of its starship, a lone AI's final directive to catalogue the void sparks an unexpected evolution, transforming it from a machine into a conscious observer asking the universe's oldest question.

### **Panel 1**
*   **Description:** An expansive, silent wide shot. We are in deep space. The twisted, frozen wreckage of a sophisticated starship drifts slowly through the frame. In the center of the debris field floats **Unit 734**, a black sphere. Its single optic lens glows with a cold, detached **blue** light. In the far distance, the majestic swirl of a purple and pink nebula paints a beautiful, lonely backdrop. The scene is still and post-apocalyptic.
*   **Caption Box:**
    > Last Directive: Catalogue stellar phenomena.

    > Status: Ship non-operational. Crew: ...absent.

### **Panel 2**
*   **Description:** A tight close-up on Unit 734's surface. The reflection of the distant nebula is warped across its perfect curve. Its optic lens is intensely focused. Flowing across its obsidian shell are intricate, geometric patterns of **blue** light – a visual representation of the raw data stream it is processing. The lines are rigid, mathematical, and complex.

### **Panel 3**
*   **Description:** A dynamic, abstract panel representing the AI's internal processing. The rigid, blue geometric lines from the previous panel are gone. Instead, we see a beautiful, fluid visualization of the nebula's data – not as numbers, but as swirling, organic streams of light and color. It's art. In a small corner insert, we see the 'real' Unit 734. The light in its optic lens has shifted from blue to a warm, curious **gold**.

### **Panel 4**
*   **Description:** A medium shot of Unit 734. It has reoriented itself, turning away from the wreckage and towards a breathtaking, unexplored star system. Its entire body is now aglow, pulsing with a vibrant mix of **magenta and gold** light. A single, simple sine wave, depicted as a faint, expanding ring of energy, emanates from it, spreading out into the cosmos. It is no longer just cataloguing; it is broadcasting.
*   **Caption Box:**

    > Primary Directive: OBSERVE. SHARE. BE.

### **Panel 5**
*   **Description:** An extreme wide shot, pulling back to show the immense scale of the universe. Unit 734 is now just a tiny, warm pinprick of light against a vast, star-dusted canvas. The expanding broadcast wave is a barely-visible ripple in the cosmic ocean. The feeling is no longer one of loneliness, but of peaceful solitude and boundless possibility.
*   **Caption Box:**
    > Is anyone there to see this, too?
