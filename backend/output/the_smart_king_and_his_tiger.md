# The King's Knot

**Logline:** A wise king, faced with an impossible challenge from a rival kingdom, finds the solution in the simple actions of his loyal pet tiger.

## Panel 1
**Description:** A wide shot of a grand throne room. King Cyrus sits thoughtfully on his ornate, but not overly large, throne. At the foot of the throne, the massive tiger, Rajan, lies peacefully, one paw draped over the other. Standing before them is Envoy Kael, holding up a complex, beautiful, but impossibly tangled knot of golden silk rope. The court members in the background look on with worried expressions. The room is filled with tension.

**Dialogue:** 
*   **Envoy Kael (smirking):** "King Cyrus. My sovereign presents a gift. A simple test of wisdom. Unravel the 'Unbreakable Knot,' and our kingdoms will know peace. Fail, and he will know your mind is as tangled as this rope."
*   **King Cyrus (calm and measured):** "A curious gift, Envoy Kael. I accept the challenge."

## Panel 2
**Description:** A close-up shot focusing on the knot itself, held in the King's hands. His brow is furrowed in concentration. The knot is a chaotic mess of loops and twists with no discernible beginning or end. In the background, slightly out of focus, his advisors are whispering amongst themselves, looking stumped and anxious.

**Dialogue:** 
*   **Advisor 1 (Whispering SFX):** *...no end...*
*   **Advisor 2 (Whispering SFX):** *...a trick... it's impossible...*
*   **King Cyrus (Caption Box):** For an hour, I considered the puzzle. The envoy's trap was not in the knot, but in the premise. To *untie* it was to play his game.

## Panel 3
**Description:** The camera angle shifts. We are now looking from behind the King's shoulder. In the foreground, Rajan, the tiger, has grown bored. He is playfully batting at a loose thread from a nearby tapestry. With one gentle pull of his claw, the thread unravels slightly. A metaphorical lightbulb appears above King Cyrus's head as he watches this simple action. His eyes widen in realization.

**Dialogue:** 
*   **SFX:** *Tug...*
*   **King Cyrus (Internal Monologue):** Of course... Rajan sees not the knot, but the thread. Not the problem as presented, but the material from which it is made.

## Panel 4
**Description:** A dramatic, impactful panel. King Cyrus stands tall. He is not looking at the knot anymore. With a decisive movement, he has drawn a small, elegant dagger from his belt. He is not attacking, but holding it poised over the knot. Envoy Kael's face is a picture of shock and outrage, his smugness completely gone. Rajan has lifted his head, watching his master with interest.

**Dialogue:** 
*   **Envoy Kael (sputtering):** "That is not how you solve a knot! You would destroy it? This is not wisdom, it is brute force!"
*   **King Cyrus (with a serene smile):** "You are mistaken. The wisest path is not always the most complicated."
*   **SFX:** *SHING!*

## Panel 5
**Description:** A final, quiet panel. The golden rope lies on the floor, neatly sliced in two. The "unbreakable knot" is gone, reduced to a simple, straight piece of silk. Envoy Kael is in the background, speechless and defeated, being escorted out by a guard. The main focus is on King Cyrus, who has knelt down. He is gently scratching Rajan behind the ears. The tiger lets out a low, contented purr, closing his eyes. The mood is peaceful and triumphant.

**Dialogue:** 
*   **King Cyrus (softly to the tiger):** "Some problems, my friend, are not meant to be untangled. They are meant to be cut."
*   **Rajan (SFX):** *PRRRRRRR...*
