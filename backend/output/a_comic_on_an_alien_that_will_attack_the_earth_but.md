Thought: I have successfully called the Comic Layout Designer tool and received the markdown output for the comic strip. The output includes panel descriptions, dialogue, and placeholders for images. As per the instructions, I must return only the tool's markdown output.# Comic Strip Layout

## Panel 1
Description: A wide, low-angle shot looking up from a terrified city street. Skyscrapers frame the panel. Dominating the sky is the **World-Ender**, a colossal alien entity, its tentacles coiling menacingly around the tops of buildings. It's dusk, and the city lights reflect weakly against its dark, shimmering hide. Purple energy crackles around it, casting an eerie glow on the clouds. People below are fleeing in panic.

Dialogue: World-Ender (telepathic, booming caption): *...YOUR WORLD IS AN ANOMALY. A CACOPHONY OF FLEETING LIFE. I BRING THE SILENCE OF THE VOID.*

## Panel 2
Description: A close-up on the ground. A car has been crushed flat. Stepping off it is **Goliath's** massive, armored boot. In the background, **Aether** lands gracefully, her body surrounded by a soft cyan aura. Goliath is clenching his fists, looking up with grim determination. Aether has one hand raised, her eyes glowing as she analyzes the alien.

Dialogue: Goliath: All that talk... does it ever just say "hi" before trying to eat a planet?
Aether: It's not talking, Marcus. It's broadcasting. It doesn't see us as worthy of a conversation.

## Panel 3
Description: Action shot. Goliath has launched himself into the air, a streak of motion aimed at the World-Ender's central body. The alien swats him aside with a massive tentacle. The impact is shown with a huge **"KRAKOOM!"** sound effect. Goliath is sent flying backwards, his armor sparking.

Dialogue: Goliath: RRRRAGH!
World-Ender (Caption): *INSECT.*

## Panel 4
Description: Aether is in the foreground, her body now blazing with cyan energy. She has her hands up, creating a shimmering energy shield that catches the crashing Goliath, saving him from plowing through a building. In the background, the World-Ender's central eye begins to glow with immense purple power, charging a beam.

Dialogue: Aether: Brute force isn't working! Its energy output is off the charts. I have an idea, but I'll need a massive power source.
Goliath (grunting): What's bigger than that thing's death ray?

## Panel 5
Description: An intense, dynamic panel. The World-Ender fires its devastating purple energy beam downwards. Aether is floating directly in its path, but instead of resisting, she has her arms wide open, absorbing the full blast. The purple energy is being funneled into her body, which is now glowing almost white-hot. Her suit's circuits are flaring. Goliath is below her, looking up in awe and concern.

Dialogue: Aether: YOU! YOU ARE! CATCH ME, GOLIATH!
World-Ender (Caption): *FUTILE GESTURE. BE UNMADE.*

## Panel 6
Description: The climax. A ground-level perspective looking up. Goliath has braced himself, muscles straining. Aether, now a comet of pure, redirected energy, has been THROWN by Goliath like a javelin. She is a piercing cyan spear against the dark sky, aimed directly at the World-Ender's glowing central eye. The alien shows its first sign of alarm as the beam of light is about to hit its core. The sound effect **"VREEEEEEE!!!"** dominates the panel.

Dialogue: Goliath (yelling): GO GET 'IM, ARIS!
Final Caption: As the sun rises over a saved city, the only silence is the one left by the vanquished invader.
