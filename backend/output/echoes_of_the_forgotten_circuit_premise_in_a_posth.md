**ERROR: Comic assembly cannot proceed.**

**Reason:** Panel validation has FAILED. Four out of six panel images are missing from the generation results (Panel 3, Panel 4, Panel 5, Panel 6).

**Action Required:** Please return to the image generation stage to create the missing panels. Manual intervention is required. Do not attempt assembly again until all six panels have been successfully generated and validated.
