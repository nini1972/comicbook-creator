Thought: I have successfully called the `Comic Layout Designer` tool with the extracted panel descriptions, dialogue, and image paths. The tool returned the complete comic strip in markdown format. According to the instructions, I must return ONLY this markdown output.# Comic Strip Layout

## Panel 1
Description: A wide, establishing shot. We are in a vast, sprawling junkyard that stretches to the horizon under a hazy, rust-colored sky. In the foreground, **Handy** is perched atop a pile of discarded computer monitors, one finger pointing forward with purpose. Below him, **Bolt** rolls to a stop, his single wheel kicking up a small cloud of dust. Bolt’s camera-eye is zoomed in, focusing on something in the distance. The mood is quiet and watchful.

Dialogue: **BOLT:** "Analysis complete. Lumin-Bloom confirmed. Probability of successful retrieval: 47.8%."
**SFX:** *tap tap tap*

## Panel 2
Description: A point-of-view shot from Bolt's perspective (a circular frame with a heads-up display overlay). In the distance, perched precariously on a teetering spire of old cars and girders, is the **Lumin-Bloom**—a delicate, flower-like object glowing with a soft, pulsating blue light. Suddenly, a sleek, black, single-eyed **Rival Drone** zips into the frame from the right, its red optic locking onto the same target.

Dialogue: **BOLT:** "Correction. Rival drone detected. Probability of success dropping rapidly."

## Panel 3
Description: Action shot! A low angle looking up at Handy, who has launched into a full sprint. It is a blur of motion, "running" on two fingers across a narrow, rusty pipe. In the background, Bolt follows on the ground level, his wheel spinning fast. Further in the background, the Rival Drone is ascending vertically towards the spire, a clean, menacing shape against the junk.

Dialogue: **BOLT:** "Route Epsilon, Handy! Go! Go! Go!"
**SFX (Handy):** *SCUTTLE SCUTTLE SCUTTLE*
**SFX (Drone):** *WHIIIRRRRR*

## Panel 4
Description: The climax! A dynamic, diagonal panel. Handy is in mid-air, leaping across a wide chasm between two junk piles. Its fingers are stretched out, straining to reach the Lumin-Bloom, which is just inches away. The Rival Drone is right behind Handy, its metallic claw extended and about to snatch the prize. Bolt is visible far below, one of his spindly arms raised, a small antenna on it glowing with energy.

Dialogue: **BOLT:** "EMP burst engaged! NOW!"
**SFX (EMP Burst):** *zzzzZAP!*

## Panel 5
Description: A close-up on Handy's fingers gently closing around the delicate stem of the Lumin-Bloom. The blue light from the bloom illuminates every crack and seam on Handy's "skin." In the background, out of focus, we see the Rival Drone sparking and tumbling downwards, its red eye flickering out. The moment is tense but triumphant.

Dialogue: **SFX (Lumin-Bloom):** *thrummmm...*
**SFX (Drone crashing, distant):** *CRUNCH*

## Panel 6
Description: A final, heartwarming panel. Inside a small shelter made from a hollowed-out washing machine, Handy and Bolt are together. The Lumin-Bloom is planted in a small pot of soil, casting a warm, peaceful blue glow over the entire scene. Handy is giving Bolt a gentle "pat" on his head casing (a few fingers resting affectionately on top). Bolt's camera-eye is shaped into a happy, curved crescent, reflecting the bloom's light.

Dialogue: **BOLT:** "New probability of a comfortable night: 100%."
**HANDY:** *(Gives a confident Thumbs-Up gesture).*
