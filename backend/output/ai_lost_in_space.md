Error: Comic assembly cannot proceed. The panel validation status is FAIL.

**Reason:**
Image generation for all 5 panels of "ECHO-7" has failed across three separate attempts. The root cause appears to be a persistent server-side file access issue preventing the image generator from locating character reference files.

**Action Required: Manual Intervention**

1.  **Halt Workflow:** The automated process for "ECHO-7" is halted.
2.  **Technical Investigation:** A developer must investigate the image generation server's file system permissions and path mapping to resolve the underlying "File not found" error.
3.  **Regenerate All Panels:** Once the server issue is resolved, a full regeneration of all 5 panels must be initiated.
4.  **Re-Validation:** After regeneration, the new panel images must be submitted for a new validation check.

Do not proceed to assembly until a validation check results in a "PASS" status with 100% of panel images verified.
