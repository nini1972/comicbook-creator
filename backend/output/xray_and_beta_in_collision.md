Comic assembly has been halted. The preceding image generation step failed validation.

**VALIDATION STATUS: FAIL**

**Reason:** The image generation task failed to produce any of the required six panel images. No panel assets are available for assembly.

**Recommendation:** Manual intervention is required. Please escalate this failure to the technical team to investigate the root cause of the generation failure and assign this task for manual panel creation. Do not re-run the assembly process until all panel images have been successfully generated and verified.
