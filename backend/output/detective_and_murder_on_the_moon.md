## Panel 1
Description: WIDE SHOT. The interior of a high-tech lunar geology lab. The room is stark and sterile, but now in disarray – scattered moon rocks, an overturned sample tray. A massive viewport dominates the back wall, showing the brilliant blue-and-white Earth hanging in the void above the grey, cratered lunar surface. In the center of the room lies the body of DR. ARIS THORNE. His spacesuit is intact, but his helmet is shattered, a spiderweb of cracks originating from a single point. A small, crystalline formation of frozen blood glitters on the floor near his head. DETECTIVE KAITO stands over the body, his own helmet off. He’s in his trench coat spacesuit, his face grim and deeply lined by the harsh overhead lighting.
Dialogue: KAITO (Caption): They call this place 'Tranquility Base II.' A fresh start for humanity. No crime. No grime.
KAITO (Caption): They were wrong. Murder is a weed. It grows anywhere.

## Panel 2
Description: CLOSE-UP SHOT. Focus on the floor next to the victim's head. Kaito’s gloved finger points, but doesn't touch. Next to the sharp, frozen crystals of blood is a small, perfectly round PUDDLE OF LIQUID WATER. It’s impossible. Tiny wisps of steam rise from it in the cold, controlled atmosphere of the lab. Kaito's eyes, seen at the edge of the panel, are narrowed in intense focus. A datapad in his other hand displays the lab's ambient readings: `TEMP: 15°C / ATMOS: 0.8 BAR`.

Dialogue: KAITO: "Forensics bot, run atmospheric analysis again."
FORENSICS BOT (Off-panel): "Analysis complete. Nitrogen-Oxygen mix, standard pressure. H2O should sublimate or freeze instantly."
KAITO: "...Then what in the hell are you?"

## Panel 3
Description: MEDIUM SHOT. A sparse, metallic interrogation room. A single light source hangs from the ceiling, casting the rest of the room in deep shadow. Kaito sits across a simple metal table from DR. LENA PETROVA. She is composed, her hands folded neatly on the table. She maintains unshakable eye contact. Kaito slides a small, transparent evidence bag onto the table. Inside is a single, large crystal of rock salt.

Dialogue: KAITO: "Dr. Thorne was the lead on finding pure water ice deposits. Your project, Dr. Petrova, was analyzing the saline content of deep-core samples."
PETROVA: "My research is a matter of public record, Detective."
KAITO: "So is your budget review. Your funding was being cut. Thorne's 'pure water' project was getting it all."

## Panel 4
Description: DYNAMIC SPLIT PANEL.
LEFT SIDE (Flashback): A smaller inset panel showing a close-up of Petrova’s hands in her own lab. She is injecting a clear, viscous fluid from a syringe into a custom-built, high-pressure water pistol. The scene is lit with a cold, blue light. Her face is set with grim determination.
RIGHT SIDE (Present): Back in the interrogation room. A tight close-up on Kaito’s face. He is leaning forward into the light, his expression one of absolute certainty. His words from the dialogue below connect the two images.

Dialogue: KAITO (V.O.): "You found a way to make your 'dead end' research useful. A super-saturated saline solution. The ultimate anti-freeze."
KAITO (V.O.): "You didn't shoot him with a bullet. You shot a high-pressure jet of saltwater at his helmet. The saline didn't just melt the ice on his visor from a previous EVA... it chemically corroded the plexiglass. The pressure did the rest."

## Panel 5
Description: WIDE SHOT of the interrogation room again. The spell is broken. Dr. Petrova’s composure has completely crumbled. Her head is in her hands, her shoulders shaking. She is no longer a cold suspect, but a desperate human being. Kaito has stood up and is putting on his helmet, his back mostly to her. He casts a long, imposing shadow that falls across the table and over her. Through the window behind them, the Earth hangs, a silent, beautiful, and impossibly distant home.

Dialogue: PETROVA: "He called my life's work... a footnote! He was going to name the largest water deposit in the system after himself! My data... he stole MY data!"
KAITO (Caption): Same planet, same story. Just a longer drop and a harder landing.
