# **Sky-Crossed**

A flashy, impulsive bolt of Lightning learns a lesson in power and responsibility from her stoic, mighty partner, Thunder.

### **Panel 1**
**Description:** A wide, dramatic shot of a roiling night sky. Dark, heavy clouds fill the frame. Lina (Lightning) is a brilliant streak of white-hot energy, zig-zagging across the panel in a joyful, chaotic display. She is seen as a blur of motion, her form just barely coalescing in the center, a wide, cocky grin on her face. In the background, partially obscured by the clouds, we see the massive, silhouetted shoulder and head of Thorne (Thunder). His form is still and unimposing for now.

**Lina (shouted, crackling SFX):** "Catch me if you can, old man!"
**Thorne (a low rumble, SFX: R-R-R-U-M-B-L-E):** "..."

### **Panel 2**
**Description:** A medium shot, focused on Lina. She has stopped her frantic movement and is hovering, crackling with power. Her gaze is directed downward, off-panel. Her grin has turned mischievous. Below her, on the crest of a dark, lonely hill, stands a single, ancient, gnarled tree. It looks small and fragile from this height. Energy gathers around her pointed finger.

**Lina (to herself, whispering with static):** "Let's give the little world a real show... A little *spark* to remember me by."

### **Panel 3**
**Description:** A close-up on Thorne's face. His eyes, previously closed or downcast, are now wide open, glowing with an intense purple light. His stony expression is set in a deep, powerful frown. His mouth is open, and from it, immense sound waves (visualized as concentric, distorted circles of purple energy) are blasting forward, dominating the panel. This is a display of pure, raw power.

**Thorne (a single, deafening word. The font should be huge, cracked, and seem to shake the panel itself):** "**ENOUGH!**"
**SFX:** KRA-KA-THOOOOOOOM!

---

### **Panel 4**
**Description:** Same angle as Panel 2, but the scene is drastically different. Lina is blown back, her form flickering and unstable. The bolt of energy she was about to fire has dissipated. Her hair is messy, and her eyes are wide with shock and fear, looking up and back towards Thorne. The air around her is visibly vibrating from the force of the sound. The little tree below is untouched but shaking violently, a few leaves torn away by the sheer force of the shockwave.

**(No dialogue. Just Lina's wide, stunned eyes).**

### **Panel 5**
**Description:** A final, wide panel showing the two figures in the sky. Thorne's immense form is calm again, his glowing eyes now soft, looking down at Lina. Lina is no longer crackling with arrogant energy. She looks small and humbled. Her gaze shifts from Thorne down to the fragile tree on the hill, a look of dawning understanding and regret on her face. The storm clouds begin to part slightly, allowing a single moonbeam to illuminate the tree, highlighting its resilience.

**Thorne (his voice a quiet, deep rumble, no longer a shout):** "We are the storm... Not the destruction."
**Lina (soft, almost inaudible):** "...the storm."
